So, he\'s on death row and the executioner approaches him.\\n\\n"What would you like for your last meal?"\\n\\n"I would like a banana please."\\n\\nThe executioner thinks it\'s weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.\\n\\nA few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.\\n\\n"You again? Shit. What do you want this time?"\\n\\n"Two bananas please."\\n\\nThe executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There\'s no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.\\n\\nSome time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.\\n\\n"Let me guess. Three bananas?"\\n\\n"Actually yes! How did you know?"\\n\\n"Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry."\\n\\nSo, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.\\n\\n"I dont get it," says the executioner.
