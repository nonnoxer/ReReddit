We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!\\n\\n-----\\n\\nLinks:\\n\\n* [YouTube Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7293kAiPZw)\\n* [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php)\\n* [Gravitational wave primer by Discovery](http://news.discovery.com/space/what-you-need-to-know-about-gravitational-waves-160210.htm)\\n* [Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1853)\\n\\n-----\\n\\nFAQ:\\n\\n> Where do they come from?\\n\\nThe source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). \\n\\n> How fast do they go?\\n\\nGravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).\\n\\n> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?\\n\\nThe 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).\\n\\nIn 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.\\n\\n> Does this mean we can control gravity?\\n\\nNo. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).\\n\\n> What's the practical application?\\n\\n[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.\\n\\n> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?\\n\\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that!

Where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?\\n\\n****\\n\\n**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I\'d honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I\'ll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.\\n\\nFirst of all, I\'m gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. \\n\\n* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. \\n\\n* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. \\n\\n* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in "is/us/os" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. \\n\\n* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, "Tutankhamen" (twt-\\ua725n\\u1e2b-\\u0131\\u0357mn) was likely pronounced as something like "Tawat \'ankhu qaman" ([ta\\u02c8wa\\u02d0t \\u02c8\\u0295a\\u02d0nxu \\u0294a\\u02c8ma\\u02d0n]).\\n\\n* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for "mouth" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word ("ro") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast \'s comment to see his full explanation on this point. \\n\\nThanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn\'t know I had.

I\'ve seen some of your answers, and maybe I wasn\'t very clear. Yes, I can remember and imagine pictures, places and random things. It\'s just that for music, it\'s WAY easier to "replay" it on my mind. With pictures, it\'s a little bit more difficult. I do not have aphantasia.\\n\\nSome of you have pointed out that this varies from person to person.  It made sense to me that it was a common behavior, but after reading your comments and thinking about it for some time, I saw that my initial thought was erroneous. Thanks for pointing that out.\\n\\nAlso, some of you pointed out that it\'s easier to "replay" music in our head for evolutionary reasons.  As our eyes are always occupied with seeing things, if we could just imagine a vivid lion in front of us, it would be a disaster.  That is something that I\'ve never thought about, and makes a lot of sense.\\n\\nAnd, some of you also said that it\'s related to repetition. If I\'m listening to a song over and over, my brain will remember it perfectly after some repetitions. \\n\\nSo, after reading your answers, I\'ve come to the understanding that this happens because of a series of factors that when combined, will favor my hearing memory instead of my visual memory.

I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.\\n\\nThen I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.\\n\\nSo I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.\\n\\nWhich brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?\\n\\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.\\n\\nThe major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.\\n\\nDoes that kinda summ it up?";;;;1494189762.0b'Do tall people have larger internal organs?

The Moon**\\n\\n>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an \'object\' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.\\n\\n **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**\\n\\n> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  \\n>  \\n>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth\\u2019s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). \\n\\n**3. Moldavite \\u2013 Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**\\n\\n> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) \\n\\n**4. Hydrogen and Helium** \\n\\n>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: "Jean\'s escape" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\\\\_escape#Jeans\\\\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   \\n>  \\n>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\\\\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\\\\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\\\\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\\\\[10\\\\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\\\\[10\\\\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\\\\[11\\\\] \\n\\n**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** \\n\\n>u/Clovis69: volcanos don\'t have the force to do that and generally a "supervolcano" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) \\n>\\n>u/KnowanUKnow : It\'s unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn\'t enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn\'t enough. There\'s something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. \\n\\nBut Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale.

My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg\\n\\nMy lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nOne of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. \\n\\nBy producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.\\n\\n\\nI'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions.

There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).\\n\\n> Before this time the symbol \\u03c0 has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.\\n\\n> The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *Mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *Introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.\\n\\nCheck out the comments below for more and to ask follow-up questions!

I search for supermassive black holes, particularly in the distant universe (lookback times of 7-12 billion years ago), in order to figure out what effect these hidden monsters are having on their host galaxies. Most of my work has been centered around developing techniques to find supermassive black holes that aren\'t very active-their host galaxies are still in the prime of star formation.\\n\\nRecently, I stumbled across the opposite scenario. I found a population of the most active supermassive black holes out there. These black holes are so active that we normally would not expect their host galaxies to be intact and forming lots of stars... and yet, they are! I coined this population "cold quasars" due to the amount of cold gas and dust they have.

Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.\\n\\nIf you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: [https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY)\\n\\nMy lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.\\n\\nIf you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.\\n\\nYou can read my university's story about it here: [http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL](http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL)\\n\\nI'm here to talk about all things CRISPR, genetic engineering, immunology, or any other part of my work.

It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it\'s there:\\n\\nI was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was "1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __" and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was " x^2 ", I found the answer via another method.\\n\\nI found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: "3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13". I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: "2, 2, 2, 2, 2".\\n\\nI thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.\\n\\nI decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series "1, 8, 27, 64, 125" ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61"; the second time yields: "12, 18, 24"; the third time bottoms out at: "6, 6".\\n\\nSo ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2*, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6*.\\n\\nI continued this with ( x^4 ): "1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401". The differences method yields: "15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105"; again, and it yields: "50, 110, 194, 302, 434"; again, and it yields: "60, 84, 108, 132"; again, and it yields: "24, 24, 24".\\n\\nSo ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.\\n\\nFinally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I\'ve marked with the asterisks? \\n\\nAdditionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?\\n\\ntl;dr:\\n\\n2 underlies ( x^2 ),\\n6 underlies ( x^3 ),\\n24 underlies ( x^4 ),\\nand so on, for reasons explained above.\\nWhy?';;;;1482997480.0b'By guessing the rate of the Expansion of the universe, do we know how big the unobservable universe is?';;;;5193;;;;5sdyes;;;;askscience;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5sdyes/by_guessing_the_rate_of_the_expansion_of_the/;;;;642;;;;b'So we are closer in size to the observable universe than the plank lentgh, but what about the unobservable universe.';;;;1486412982.0b"The Gympie Gympie plant (link in comment) can cause pain that lasts years.

Assuming that these 2 objects both have an atmosphere, would it be possible for these atmospheres to mingle?  Or would an orbit that close together be unstable (due to atmospheric drag perhaps?).\\n\\nI\'m writing a science fiction story where it may be possible to travel from the planet to the moon while remaining in atmosphere (albeit, a very thin atmosphere).\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nWhat about if I introduce a third body?  A planet, a moon with a very elliptic orbit and a second much further out moon.  The closer moon\'s elliptic orbit would usually carry it close to the planet at perigee, but not close enough for their atmospheres to touch/mingle.  But once every thousand orbits or so the second moon would influence the other\'s orbit enough to make it dip closer to the planet (lets say a couple of thousand KM of the planets surface, for argument\'s sake this is a large planet with a deep atmosphere), then on the next orbit it would "straighten it back out again".\\n\\nCould this be stable?  Would tidal forces rip the moon apart?  Would the constant drag in those once-in-a-thousand close passes be enough to destabilize the moon\'s orbit and send it crashing into the planet (or slingshot it out to space)?\\n\\nFor the sake of the story this has to be a stable arrangement that has existed for untold millions of years.  Also the close passes would have to be within living memory (a couple of thousand years apart would work, maybe as far apart as 10,000 years).\\n\\nAs a side note, I suppose I\'ll have to write in that at perigee whether or not the atmospheres mingle the moon\'s gravitational influence would cause massive tides, increases in volcanism, and just general doomsday scenarios.

I can't quite remember if I was going to call someone or to get water to dilute the mixture.\\n\\nI turned around and started walking and as I turned a corner about 5 meters away from where the bucket was left standing, I heard an incredibly loud bang and saw pieces of the red bucket fly past me and land in the pool and on the lawn over 10 meters away. There was literally nothing left at ground zero other than a few white stains from the powder. It was a really powerful explosion.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis happened quite some years ago when I used to look after the pool at home, so the details may be a bit sketchy. I've always thought about that incident, what if I hadn't moved away? I could have been permanently blinded, or developed some kind of respiratory issue, possibly even hearing damage?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nP.S. the brands were HTH and Clarity in that order (i think)\\n\\nThere was no outside contamination that I know of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the replies and explanations so far.

Just a couple things, This *was* a long time ago like I said, so it might not have bubbled for 10 seconds, the gas might have been green instead of yellow, etc. All I know for sure is that it was loud, it started raining red plastic bits, there was definitely no lid on the bucket and that there were 2 brands of chlorine in a bucket.";;;;1537904442.0b'Why is there things like depression that make people constantly sad but no disorders that cause constant euphoria?';;;;5037;;;;2lfaw9;;;;askscience;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2lfaw9/why_is_there_things_like_depression_that_make/;;;;976;;;;b'why can our brain make us constantly sad but not the opposite?\\n\\nEdit: holy shit this blew up thanks guys';;;;1415263172.0b'Today i dripped some super glue on the colored print of my t-shirt by accident.

We\'re the team of researchers behind the world\'s first fully synthetic protein "switch" that can control living cells. It\'s called LOCKR, and it\'s a general building block to create circuits in cells, similar to the electrical circuits that drive basically all modern electronics (Wired called this the "biological equivalent of a PID algorithm", for any ICS people out there).\\n\\nImagine this: A patient gets a traumatic head injury, causing swelling. Some inflammation is necessary for healing, but too much can cause brain damage. The typical approach today is to administer drugs to control the swelling, but there\'s no way to know the perfect dose and the drugs often cause inflammation to plummet so low that it impedes healing.\\n\\nWith LOCKR (stands for Latching Orthogonal Cage Key pRoteins), you could create "smart" cells programmed to sense inflammation and respond automatically to maintain a desired level - not too high, not too low, but enough to maximize healing without causing permanent damage. BTW, we\'ve made the system freely available to all academics..\\n\\nWe\'re here to talk about protein design, genetic engineering and synthetic biology, from present efforts to future possibilities.

To celebrate, we\'d like to open up a **Frog Megathread**. Our biologists will be on hand to answer your questions!\\n\\n[**Anura**](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Anura/) is the largest extant (i.e. not extinct) order of amphibians, with over 6,300 documented species. There are a few things that set frogs apart: \\n\\n- "Anura" means "without a tail" - a reference to the loss of their tails as adults. \\n- One of the most unique features is called a [urostyle](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/obl4he/vertebratediversity/frogs_and_toads.html), and it\'s formed by fused sacral vertebrae. \\n- They lack ribs, and have relatively few presacral vertebrae (fewer than 9, usually 8). \\n- They also fuse some limb bones together: the radius and ulna in the arm fuse into the radio-ulna, and the tibia and fibula fuse into the tibiofibula.\\n\\nWe can\'t talk about frogs without mentioning that amphibians are experiencing a global decline, and are going extinct [much more quickly than background extinction rates](https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf) (PDF). There are a number of causes at play. \\n\\nOne is known as [**amphibian chytrid fungus**](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/bd-frogs-apocalypse-disease/585862/). This fungus has caused the extinction of more species than any other pathogen. It has caused the decline of 501 amphibian species, caused a further 124 to drop by 90% or more, and caused the extinction of 90.\\n\\n[Additional factors in amphibian decline](https://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/1406) include habitat change (destruction or loss), affecting as many as 63% of amphibian species; invasive species including fish or even other amphibian species; environmental toxins like pesticides; and global climate change. \\n\\nToday we\'d like to celebrate our froggy friends, call attention to the importance of their conservation, and answer any questions you may have.

We also host a podcast called [Outrage & Optimism](https://globaloptimism.com/podcast/) where we interview journalists and global leaders on how to drive social and environmental change. \\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAgain, our guests will be here at 4:30pm ET (21:30 UT).";;;;1582747204.0b'Do artificial lighting and hydroponics affect the nutrient profile of plants ?';;;;3;;;;fa5kje;;;;askscience;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fa5kje/do_artificial_lighting_and_hydroponics_affect_the/;;;;1;;;;b'Any studies comparing them to plants grown in dirt with natural sunlight?

Here ~[70 researchers][3] can use 6 TEMs study a wide variety of materials science topics, from the cathodes of Li ion batteries to the mechanics of shape memory alloys, from magnetic ceramic oxides to nanoparticle catalysts.\\n\\nWhy do we need electrons to image the nanoscale?\\nThe resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the light used (0.4 \\xb5m for blue light).\\nElectrons however are also waves, and fast electrons (i.e. accelerated with a tension above, say, 30000 Volts) have an extremely short wavelength, of only a few picometers.\\nUsing electromagnetic fields we can steer and focus these electrons beams just like we do on light by using glass lenses.\\nWe get resolutions all the way down to 0.05 nm, that is a twentieth of a millionth of a millimeter (or 2 billionths of an inch in freedom units).\\nThis is such a good resolution, that it allows us to even look at the [atoms that make up solid materials][1]!\\n(No, seriously, how cool is that??)\\nWe use these capabilities to study the link between the microscopic structure and shape of materials and their macroscopic properties.\\n\\nMy personal focus is on the development of methodologies, that is I try to find ways to use or misuse electron microscopes to measure the proporties of the samples with better precision, clarity or even study things that we couldn't before.\\nFor instance, I recently demonstrated a [new method][4] to measure deformations (strain) in materials with nanometer resolution with a precision of up to 1 part in 5000, which is very important when prototyping or producing semiconductor devices.\\nA more exotic interest of mine is that of wave function manipulation.\\nSince the state and properties of the electrons are defined by their wavefunction, we can give them new and interesting properties intentionally changing the wavefunction. It's a bit like having a quantum sandbox.\\nI did plenty of research on [electron vortex beams][5], a weird type of beam rotating around its own axis which therefore possesses it's own [magnetic moment][6], and interacts with mangnetic fields in a peculiar way, but also others such as the [Airy waves][7], which possess freakish properties such as accelerating in absence of external forces.\\n\\nIf you want to know more about my research, here is my [Google Scholar][8] profile, all of my articles on the [arXiv][9].\\n\\nI will be here between 12:00 EST (17:00 UTC, 18:00 CET) and 16:00 EST (21:00 UTC, 22:00 CET) to answer your questions.\\n\\nGiulio\\n\\nEDIT: ** 23:00 CET Finally checking out, my fingers can't type anymore. I'll try to pass by tomorrow and answer a couple follow ups.

I know that the Earth is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees from perpendicular from the plane of the Solar system. I also know that the plane of the Solar system is tiled about 60 degrees from the plane of the Milky Way. I was just wondering how these two tilts combine and how tilted the Earth would be if you looked at its tilt with respect to the Milky Way instead of the Solar system, if it even remains at a constant degree of tilt over the course of time.\\n\\nFor example, if the Solar system is tilted at 60 degrees from the Milky Way, and the Earth is tilted in the same rotational direction by 23.5 degrees, the poles of the Earth would be approximately 83.5 degrees tilted from perpendicular with respect to the Milky Way plane, meaning that the Earth's poles would be pointing almost directly across the Milky Way. However, if the Earth's tilt was in the opposite direction with respect to the Solar system's tilt, the Earth's poles would be tilted only 36.5 degrees from the Milky Way plane. Of course, the Earth's tilt could be in any arbitrary direction with respect to the other planes, so I was wondering what the actual angle between the Earth's axial tilt and the Milky Way's galactic plane, if there's even a semi-constant angle to be found.";;;;1582627876.0b'In a study to test medication, why must one group be given a placebo?';;;;2;;;;f95zpu;;;;askscience;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f95zpu/in_a_study_to_test_medication_why_must_one_group/;;;;22;;;;b"I've never understood the point of the placebo if it doesn't do anything to the body.

I recently listened to Scott Aaronson\'s conversation with Lex Fridman, and an interview he did for Scientific American, regarding quantum computing (QC from now on) and have a question regarding how a QC finds a solution. \\n\\nThis is an excerpt from the interview: \\n\\n"In particular, if an event can happen one way with a positive amplitude, and another way with a negative amplitude, those two amplitudes can \\u201cinterfere destructively\\u201d and cancel each other out, so that the event never happens at all.  The goal, in quantum computing, is always to choreograph things so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading there have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes, so they cancel each other out, while the paths leading to the right answer reinforce."\\xb9\\n\\nMy question(s) is the following: \\n\\nI) When he talks about choreographing amplitudes, is he essentially saying that we take a problem with a vast solution space, of which we know a large subset of true and false solutions, and try to "collapse" the correct wave function by cancelling out what we assume to be false values and reinforcing amplitudes that converge toward the correct answer; then hope the final measurement "collapsed" the correct solutions\' wave function? \\n\\nII) If that is the case, do we square the amplitude of that solution, as we do in physics, to get a probability? If so, does that mean we only get a value for the probability of that particular solution being the right one? \\n\\nIII) If we have to know so much about the solution in the first place and the challenge is programming an algorithm to get the correct solution, would it be impossible to have novel solutions to problems in which we have no epistemological priors about the possible solution space? \\n\\nApologies again if this is a silly question and thank you in advance for taking the time to answer it. \\n\\n[[1]](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/)';;;;1582464241.0b'If 2 photons are traveling in parallel through space unhindered, will inflation eventually split them up?';;;;6307;;;;f7as8r;;;;askscience;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f7as8r/if_2_photons_are_traveling_in_parallel_through/;;;;637;;;;b'this could cause a magnification of the distant objects, for "short" a while; then the photons would be traveling perpendicular to each other, once inflation between them equals light speed; and then they\'d get closer and closer to traveling in opposite directions, as inflation between them tends towards infinity.

Because more sodium is moved outside than potassium is moved inside, the outside of the axon becomes positively charged relative to the inside, and an action potential is created. This allows the nerve cell to send an impuls along the axon by opening sodium channels and removing the action potential.\\n\\n\\nMy question is: why is potassium needed in this situation? You're trying to get an action potential, so pumping positively charged ions to one side of a membrane makes sense. However, sodium and potassium are both positively charges ions, and you're pumping them in opposite directions. Wouldn't it be easier to pump sodium to one side of the membrane, and a negatively charged ion to the other?

Pure gold is an example of a pure substance. A pure substance is the same throughout. Every sample of a pure substance always has the same properties.

I am a behavior scientist, with deep experience in innovation and teaching. I run the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University, and I also teach my models and methods in graduate seminars. Over 25 years ago I was reading Aristotle\'s Rhetoric when I realized that someday computers would be designed to influence humans. Being a natural optimist, I imagined many benefits of combining persuasion and technology. I decided to explore this area scientifically. As a doctoral student at Stanford in the 1990s, I ran the first-ever series of experiments to discover how computers could change people\'s attitudes and behaviors. I named this new area "persuasive technology." My research won Stanford\'s Maccoby Prize and spawned an international academic conference, going on 10 years now.\\n\\nAfter graduation I started working in Silicon Valley, but I also devoted about half my time to Stanford. I founded a new Stanford lab in 1998. And each year since then, I\'ve created a new course on a topic that interests me. I no longer do industry consulting. Instead, these days I focus on teaching innovators about human behavior--my models and methods in Behavior Design--so they can create products to help people be healthier and happier. The focus areas include health, financial wellbeing, learning, productivity, and more. My current projects include the Good Habit Project, out of my design lab at Stanford; designing for behavior change; and, of course, my new book, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes that Change Everything. It was an instant New York Times bestseller for a reason: it keeps its promise to change your life with actionable tools to transform your behavior quickly and easily. There\'s a reason resolutions, repetition, and willpower don\'t work when it comes to forming lasting habits.\\n\\nI\'m here to share expertise gained from decades of my own original research and personal experience coaching thousands of others about what it takes to wire in a new habit, and what (tiny) steps you can take today to start your own life-changing transformation. My book cracks the code on a fundamental part of how human behavior works when it comes to forming new habits, framed in terms of my Fogg Behavior Model, which states that behavior happens when three elements come together at the same moment: motivation, ability, and a prompt. I write it like this: B = MAP. This model is easy to learn and apply to everyday life. When something is easy to do, we don\'t need much motivation to do it. There are no tricks here, no weird fads. It\'s basic science, and it can be applied to any behavior--so don\'t hesitate to ask me anything! I\'m so looking forward to answering all of your habit questions with specific tools, recipes, and advice.

Half the precession of the equinox is \\\\~13k years\\n2. 13k years to shift summer to winter (roughly 180 day      shift of the seasons)\\n3. 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600      years.\\n4.

Patients doing vision therapy then go through a bunch of exercises, the most recent and fun one being VR headset therapy, where you play games and each eye gets a different image and in order to play the games, the brain must adapt to seeing both images at the same time, effectively curing amblyopia and strabismus. In the end, people end up seeing 3D for the first time in their life, even though they lived their entire lives in flat 2D.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that not everyone eats the same foods and not every patient\'s brain gets the same resources, which probably affects the result of vision therapy. Some people don\'t even do vision therapy and only go to see a 3D movie and that is enough for them to rewire their brain to see from both eyes and have stereopsis for the first time in their life, while some others do vision therapy exercises for months and even years before results come in.\\n\\nI am wondering what effect on neuroplasticity does food have and how eating right foods might help people speed up results with this and other sorts of treatments.\\n\\nAnother similar treatment is for aphantasia, which is a name for a condition where people don\'t get images in their mind\'s eye, mostly because they haven\'t learned how to focus on them and instead they think in sentences only, instead of thinking with images as well, they can\'t remember how people\'s faces look like, not even how their home looks like. Weirdly enough, people with aphantasia can dream vividly. The treatment for this is called Image streaming and consists of a person closing their eyes, trying to imagine something and describing how that something looks like, which creates neural pathways between different places in the brain and over time allows people to focus on the imagery in their mind\'s eye and it also helps average people improve their imagery to a higher level.
