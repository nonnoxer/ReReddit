I\\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\\u2019 lungs daily.\\n\\n---\\n\\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\\n\\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\\n\\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\\u2019t like what he was up to. \\u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\\n\\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner\\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\\n\\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\\u2019t want my children to\\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \\n\\nI\\u2019m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate.

We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don\'t have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn\'t just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it\'s been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that.

To quote from my memoir, "I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family." Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.\\n\\nThough I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.\\n\\nWhen the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women\'s stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.\\n\\nIn 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.\\n\\nMy family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.\\n\\nMy wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\\\_1\\\\_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4)\\n\\nUSA link here :  [https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\\\_1\\\\_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6)\\n\\nHello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter.

Simply put, Robert\'s biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father\'s son.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*EDIT 2\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nRobert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:\\n\\nI\\u2019d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, \\u201cFEARLESS\\u201d \\u201cA Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.\\u201d I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler\\u2019s military.

We built a [graphic demonstrating just how little is left](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/).\\n \\nDowntown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination.

We don\\u2019t know whether these purchases will help the city\\u2019s goal.\\n \\nThe church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control.

Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.\\n \\nThe church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as \\u201cmindless robots.\\u201d But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church\\u2019s involvement.\\n \\nFor more, [read the investigation here.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/) We also published a story on what [city council members think.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/what-clearwaters-city-council-thinks-about-scientologys-downtown-takeover/)\\n \\nTimes data reporter and graphics wiz u/elimurray is also around to answer questions about how he made the graphics (check out another amazing project [here](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2016/breaking-news/orlando-nightclub-shooting/choice-chance-3d-map/).

Thanks for your questions and for your help in the fight to rein in government spying powers.\\n------------\\n\\nA mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it.  Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law. \\n \\nUnder Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.\\n\\nThe surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications.

The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don\'t really see the term "medic" as anything more than "person who gives medical assistance" I\'m sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I\'m claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I\'m also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.\\n\\nI am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I\'m planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.\\n\\nIs this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we\'re all just volunteers, and we\'re all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we\'re all stepping up cause we\'re all Hong Kongers.\\n\\n**\\u9999\\u6e2f\\u4eba\\uff0c\\u53cd\\u6297**\\n\\nEDIT 4:\\n\\nIf you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it\\n\\n* Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)\\n* Donate to legal aid organisations such as \\u661f\\u706b\\u806f\\u76df (FB Page:  [https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/](https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/)  message them and ask for ways to donate)\\n* Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)\\n* Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post\\n\\nEDIT 5:\\n\\nDue to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella, u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)\\n\\nEDIT 6: I\'ll be heading off to take a break now, I\'ll continue answering later on if I can, I\'ll be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions!

We've spent just short of a year investigating ['zombie campaigns'](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/): political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.\\n\\nWe found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members \\u2013 all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.\\n\\nIt's not just small fish either. We found [Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=paul,%20ron) over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. [He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/ron_paul.mp4) outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. [Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=bunning) since he retired. [Mark Foley](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=foley), who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. [George LeMieux](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=lemieux) hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent [$41k+ on management consulting services](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00494971&recipient_name=milano&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=12%2F31%2F2016) and then [denied to us on camera](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/g_lemieux.mp4) when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. [Mark Takai](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=takai). A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.\\n\\nAnd that's only a slice of what we've uncovered.

After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked.

These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country.

AMA";;;;50431;;;;3ux82r;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ux82r/united_airlines_sued_me_last_year_for_creating/;;;;3572;;;;b'Update: reddit hug of death, try the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skiplagged) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skiplagged-actually-cheap/id823443083) apps if website fails <3 . We\'re also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you\'re interested.\\n\\nThis is a followup to the [AMA I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/), just after the federal lawsuit was filed.\\n\\nHey guys, I founded [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com). Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don\'t. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city. \\n\\nBasically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you\'d simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. [New York to San Francisco example](http://i.imgur.com/Np06G1j.jpg). There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you\'d have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can\'t miss flights on purpose.\\n\\nWhile Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller\'s best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as "skiplagging". United Airlines didn\'t like any of this. \\n\\nAround September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.\\n\\nFast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there\'s a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I\'m 22. At worst, I\'ll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.\\n\\nSkiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be [on national tv](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-cheap-airfare-made-easier-with-skiplagged-startup/). Then cnn reached out and [published an article](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/29/news/united-orbitz-sue-skiplagged-22/). Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they\'re doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions. \\n\\nFast-forward a couple of months, United\'s partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there\'s no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.\\n\\nFrom running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community. \\n\\n**Also, I need your help.** \\n\\nThe crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000.

I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don\\u2019t have an answer to a specific question or that I don\\u2019t know enough to answer it. \\n\\nI recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series **Formative**, in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY\\n\\nThe founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple\\u2019s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.\\n\\nI\\u2019m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we\\u2019ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.\\n\\nI admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don\\u2019t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.\\n\\nFinally, I\\u2019m hosting the Silicon Valley Comic Con this weekend March 18 - 19th, so come check it out.

Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more.

I spent the last several months looking [into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/) while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida\\u2019s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings.

Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility. \\n\\nLast year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon \\u201cBJ\\u201d Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers\\u2019 practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits.

The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. \\n\\nThe silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles.

While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.\\n\\n[Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/), which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.\\n\\nTo understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions \\u2014 including state and county governments \\u2014 that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: [More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/).

His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states\\u2019 efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO\\u2019s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.\\n\\nBefore joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC\\u2019s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration\\u2019s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.\\u2013China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.\\n\\n**J. Alex Halderman** is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan\\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California\\u2019s \\u201ctop-to-bottom\\u201d electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia\\u2019s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.\\n\\nBefore Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))\\n\\nWe knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.\\n\\nAfter a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!\\n\\nAfter that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating.

I\\u2019m Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of *Brave*. In 1995, I created the JavaScript programming language in 10 days while at Netscape. I then co-founded Mozilla & Firefox, and in 2004, helped launch Firefox 1.0, which would grow to become the world\\u2019s most popular browser by 2009. Yesterday, we launched **Brave 1.0** to help users take back their privacy, to end an era of tracking & surveillance capitalism, and to reward users for their attention and allow them to easily support their favorite content creators online.\\n\\nOutside of work, I enjoy piano, chess, reading and playing with my children.

Bondy, and I\\u2019m the co-founder, CTO and lead developer at *Brave*. Other notable projects I\\u2019ve worked on include Khan Academy, Mozilla and Evernote. I was a Firefox Platform Engineer at Mozilla, Linux software developer at Army Simulation Centre, and researcher and software developer at Corel Corporation. I received Microsoft\\u2019s MVP award for Visual C++ in 2010, and am proud to be in the top 0.1% of contributors on StackOverflow.\\n\\nFamily is my "raison d\'\\xeatre". My wife Shannon and I have 3 sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher. When I\'m not working, I\'m usually running while listening to audiobooks. My longest runs were in 2019 with 2 runs just over 100 miles each. Ask me anything!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Our Goal with Brave\\n\\nYesterday, we launched the 1.0 version of our privacy web browser, *Brave*. Brave is an open source browser that blocks all 3rd-party ads, trackers, fingerprinting, and cryptomining; upgrades your connections to secure HTTPS; and offers truly Private \\u201cIncognito\\u201d Windows with *Tor*\\u2014right out of the box. By blocking all ads and trackers at the native level, **Brave is up to 3-6x faster than other browsers on page loads**, uses up to **3x less data** than Chrome or Firefox, and helps you extend battery life up to 2.5x.\\n\\nHowever, the Internet as we know it faces a dilemma. We realize that publishers and content creators often rely on advertising revenue in order to produce the content we love. The problem is that most online advertising relies on tracking and data collection in order to target users, *without their consent*. This enables malware distribution, ad fraud, and social/political troll warfare. To solve this dilemma, we came up with a solution called *Brave Rewards*, which is now available on all platforms, including iOS.\\n\\nBrave Rewards is entirely opt-in, and the idea is simple: if you choose to see privacy-respecting ads that you can control and turn off at any time, **you earn 70% of the ad revenue**. Your earnings, denominated in \\u201cBasic Attention Tokens\\u201d (BAT), accrue in a built-in browser wallet which you can then use to tip and support your favorite creators, spread among all your sites and channels, redeem for products, or exchange for cash. For example, when you navigate to a website, watch a YouTube video, or read a Reddit comment you like, you can *tip* them with a simple click. What\\u2019s amazing is that over 316,000 websites, YouTubers, etc. have already signed up, including major sites like **Wikipedia**, **The Guardian**, **The Washington Post**, **Khan Academy** and even **NPR.org**. You can too.\\n\\nIn the future, websites will also be able to run their own privacy-respecting ads that you can opt into, which will give them 70% of the revenue, and you\\u2014their audience\\u2014a 15% share (we always pay the ad slot owner 70%, and we always pay you the user at least what we get). They\\u2019re privacy-respecting because Brave moves all the interest-matching onto your device and into the browser client side, so **your data never leaves your device in the first place. Period.** All confirmations use an anonymous and unlinkable blind-signature cryptographic protocol. This flipping-the-script approach to keep all detailed intelligence and identity where your data originates, in your browser, is the key to ending personal data collection and surveillance capitalism once and for all.\\n\\nBrave is available on both desktop (Windows PC, MacOS, Linux) and on mobile (Android, iOS), and our pre-1.0 browser has already reached over 8.7 million monthly active users\\u2014something we\\u2019re very proud of. [We hope you try Brave](https://brave.com/) and join this growing movement for the future of the Web. Ask us anything!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit:** Thanks everybody! It was a pleasure answering your questions in detail. It\\u2019s very encouraging to see so many people interested in Brave\\u2019s mission and in taking online privacy seriously.

You can check out a [video of one of our light shows here](https://cueaudio.com/events/) at the Villanova-Purdue men\\u2019s basketball game two months ago. Basically, it works by using high-pitched, inaudible sound waves in a similar way that Bluetooth uses electromagnetic waves.

With the CBD boom, snake oil merchants armed with misinformation and lack of regulation have saturated the market of the popular cannabinoid. It can be confusing or even scary for people to find legitimate information and products. Not everyone knows that there are a lot of poor quality CBD products in the market. [A 2017 study published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569) suggests only about 30% of CBD products are labeled accurately.

Thank you EA for actually listening to your community and doing this AMA. Thank you everyone who upvoted this thread and made our voices heard! It\\u2019s awesomely empowering to actually get a response from a corporate monolith like EA based on a post like this. This is what happens when we rally as a community!!\\n\\nLook, while we all have fun shitting on EA (because, well, they\\u2019re pretty notoriously bad) I\\u2019d like to genuinely hear their side of the story and give them a chance to defend some of their (really confusing) choices. After becoming the account with the  most-downvoted comment of all Reddit history that I could find (almost -200k at the time of this post) I think it would be really interesting to try and hear their side. \\n\\nEdit: comment is now over -400k downvotes. \\n\\nSo, u/EACommunityTeam \\n\\n1. How will your company change your PR strategy in the face of such harsh public backlash? Any decent PR team would know that the Reddit hate is just the tip of the iceberg. People have hated your company for years. \\n2. Will your team actually change the way micro-transactions are handled in games? How do you think that would end up affecting the whole industry? Most players seem to think it would be a positive change. Do you disagree and can you give us a convincing reason why?\\n3. How do you respond to the allegations that banned user Mat is still the one behind your account? \\n4. Has the company suffered a noticeable amount of cancelled preorders/lost sales in the wake of this event? Essentially, are micro-transactions actually backfiring and losing net revenue because people just won\\u2019t buy the games anymore? How much longer do you think this can go on before you have a revolt on your hands and a massive flop of an otherwise good game, simply because people are sick of micro transactions?\\n5. How do you justify micro transactions? You\\u2019ve already paid for the game. Why should you have to pay more for loot boxes and characters? What happened to just unlocking it by getting good? \\n6. Probably the most beloved gaming company you\\u2019ll see online is CD Projeckt Red. What can you learn from their business model to improve your own? Will you consider how their PR strategy is working infinitely better than your own and consider how, in light of that, you could improve your own?\\n7. What is it like working for a company that so many people hate? Do you get crap from gamer cousins at Thanksgiving? How does the company as a whole seem to be reacting to this bad press?\\n8. What happened to single player gaming at EA? Is it just a matter of profit? Is profit really the only driving factor in making games, or does it just seem that way to an outside source? How do you plan on changing that perception if your company does care about the quality of their product beyond its ability to generate revenue?\\n9. What do you feel you have to contribute to the conversation? Is there anything you\\u2019d like to know from your playerbase that could help you make better games? Did your team even realize how deep the hate against EA went, or did it just seem like a passing internet fad? \\n\\nIf your PR team deems this acceptable, u/EACommunityTeam , I would love to hear from you. I\\u2019m guessing a few other downvoters would too. \\n\\n\\nEdit: a few other questions I\\u2019ve seen come up more than once, and to increase the amount of \\u201cneutral\\u201d questions as suggested by several people:\\n\\n10. What about Skate 4 Boy?\\n11. What about the expansion of mobile sports gaming?

He is a very active man, still doing some hunting (in his backyard), shooting game and being active in the garden. After our grandmother died in 2005, he picked up cooking, doing a course for cooking with venison (his venison cevapcici and venison meat cut into strips are super delicious) and started to do some crafting. \\n\\nOur Opa was born in 1927 in a tiny village in Lower Saxony near the border to North-Rhine-Westphalia. He was a Luftwaffe auxiliary personnel in Osnabr\\xfcck with 14/15 years for 9 months and helped during the air raids against Osnabr\\xfcck at that time. \\n\\n\\nAfterwards he had 3 months of Arbeitsdienst (Labour Service) near the city of Rheine. Following that at the end of December 1944 he was drafted in as a soldier. He applied to be a candidate reserve officer which meant that he was not send to the front line immediately. He came to the Ruhr area for training and was then transferred to Czechoslovakia for further training. His life as a soldier lasted for half a year after which he was caught and send to Romania and then to Rostov-on-Don for four and a half years as a prisoner of war. During that time he worked in a factory and he had to take part in political education in a city called Taganrog where they were educated on the benefits of communism and stalinism. They had to sign a paper that they would support communism when they would go back home.\\n\\n\\nHe came back home in 1949 and went to an agricultural school. During his time on the farm where he was in training, he met our grandmother. They married in 1957 despite her mother not being happy about the marriage.

It's easiest to show the breakdown/proof with a pic: \\n\\nPic: https://i.imgur.com/YLjn7da.png\\n\\nI'm working with them to get the money over to them.

Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!\\n\\nOver time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)\\n\\nWe decided to call the game \'Ruin of the Reckless\', mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?\\n\\nAbout two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game \'for real.\' It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable \'Backers Only\' Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.\\n\\nEdit: We\'ve gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...\\n\\n**"Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.\\nWe worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...\\nWe certainly didn\'t live for that entire time without any income!"**\\n\\nSince then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!\\n\\nI am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!\\n\\nOn release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i\'m crossing my fingers!

A poll released by the ACLU this week shows that a majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about government surveillance.

And now I've launched https://WT.Social - a completely independent organization from Wikipedia or Wikia. https://WT.social is an outgrowth and continuation of the WikiTribune pilot project.\\n\\nIt is my belief that existing social media isn't good enough, and it isn't good enough for reasons that are very hard for the existing major companies to solve because their very business model drives them in a direction that is at the heart of the problems.\\n\\nAdvertising-only social media means that the only way to make money is to keep you clicking - and that means products that are designed to be addictive, optimized for time on site (number of ads you see), and as we have seen in recent times, this means content that is divisive, low quality, click bait, and all the rest.  It also means that your data is tracked and shared directly and indirectly with people who aren't just using it to send you more relevant ads (basically an ok thing) but also to undermine some of the fundamental values of democracy.\\n\\nI have a different vision - social media with no ads and no paywall, where you only pay if you want to.  This changes my incentives immediately: you'll only pay if, in the long run, you think the site adds value to your life, to the lives of people you care about, and society in general. So rather than having a need to keep you clicking above all else, I have an incentive to do something that is meaningful to you.\\n\\nDoes that sound like a great business idea?  It doesn't to me, but there  you go, that's how I've done my career so far - bad business models!

Do you use social media to report on the news?\\n\\nFront Page Edit: Thanks r/iama for popping my front page cherry. This is an issue I first really became aware of when John Oliver ran a piece on it a while back. Sinclair is not the only media company that seeks to monopolize media markets, but they\'re by far the largest and most insidious. I honestly have no idea how to combat this in our current political environment, but I think (If you\'re in the US) contacting your representative and senator and just leaving a short message or personally written email saying that they need to get rid of Ajit Pai and restore regulation on media ownership is a good start. Voting for politicians who have taken a position against media deregulation is the next step - if those in office now won\'t represent our interests we replace them with those who will. \\n\\nI still hope that one of these anchors can contact the mods and set up an AMA. \\n\\nedit 2: per u/stackedturtles:\\n>This https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490 is the source of that video.

Why was CBD Oil ruled a Schedule 1 drug? Please be specific in your response, including cited sources and conclusive research that led you to believe CBD oil is as dangerous and deadly as heroin or meth. \\n2. With more and more states legalizing marijuana / hemp, and with more and more proof that it has multiple medical benefits and a super low risk of dependency, why do you still enforce it as a schedule 1 drug?\\n3. How do you see your agency enforcing federal marijuana laws once all 50 states have legalized both recreationally and medically, as the trend shows will happen soon? \\n4. There is no evidence that anyone has died directly as a result of "overdosing" on marijuana - but yet alcohol kills thousands each year. Can you please explain this ruling using specific data and/or research as to why alcohol is ranked as less of a danger than marijuana? \\n5. If hemp could in theory reduce our dependencies on foreign trade for various materials, including paper, medicine, and even fuel, why does your agency still rule it as a danger to society, when it has clearly been proven to be a benefit, both health-wise and economically? \\n\\nEDIT: WOW! Front page in just over an hour. Thanks for the support guys. Keep upvoting! \\n\\nEDIT 2: Many are throwing speculation that this is some sort of "karma whore" post - and that my questions are combative or loaded. I do have a genuine interest in speaking to someone with a brain in the DEA, because despite popular opinion, I\'d like to think that someone would contribute answers to my questions. As for the "combativeness" - yes, I am quite frustrated with DEA policy on marijuana (I\'m not a regular user at all, but I don\'t support their decision to keep it illegal - like virtually everyone else with a brainstem) but they are intended to get right to the root of the issue.

They want to be able to say they did something for cybersecurity, but lobbyists and the intelligence community are pushing bad bills like CISA. Surveillance defenders like Sen. Richard Burr are also using every procedural tool available to them to help move these bills quickly (like holding meetings to discuss the bill in secret). They\'ll keep doing it until we win overwhelmingly and make the bill toxic for good, like we did with SOPA. That\'s why it\'s important that everyone takes action and ownership of this fight. We know it\'s easy to feel frustrated, but it\'s incredibly important for people to know how much their calls, emails...and faxes in this case, really matter. Congress wants to focus on things people are paying attention to. It\'s our job to make sure they know people are paying attention to CISA. We couldn\'t do it without all of you.*\\n\\nEdit 3: The east coast organizations have signed off for the day, but will be checking in every now and then to answer questions.

As the deadly gas seeped its way through the doors and windows of homes, over 5,000 Kurds were killed and more than 10,000 were injured in the most brutal chemical weapons attack since World War II.\\n\\nIt is clear that Saddam Hussein ordered this genocide, but he did not do it alone. A lawsuit based on new evidence and testimony from experts hired by the German Export Authority alleges that some of Europe\\u2019s largest corporations entered into a conspiracy to build and try to hide the purpose of the chemical weapons facilities Saddam Hussein used to carry out this genocide.\\n\\nTwo people who survived the attack \\u2013a man who was 19 at the time, who still suffers from respiratory disability, and a young girl who was orphaned and blinded \\u2013 are plaintiffs in this case, members of the Halabja Chemical Victims Society, and will be joining Reddit for an AMA about the lawsuit, 30th anniversary of the attack, and the need to hold corporations like those that built Saddam\\u2019s chemical weapons accountable.\\n\\n**Answering the AMA today are two survivors. Because of language and disability, their answers may come a little more slowly than other AMAs:**\\n\\n\\n**Aras Abid Akram** was 19 years old during the attack. Prior to the attack, he worked as a retailer selling drinks imported from Baghdad. He lost ten members of his family in the attack, including his parents and eight siblings. He was transferred to Iran for treatment and stayed there for 6 months. Upon returning to Iraq, he had to stay in a complex prepared by the Saddam Regime for people who survived in the attack in Halabja. He still suffers from lung disabilities and eye disease.\\n\\n**Mardin Mahmood Fatah** was 4 years old on the day of the attack. She was severely burned and lost her vision because of the poisonous gases.  She was hospitalized in Tehran, Iran for more than 3 months and lost her consciousness for a period of time.  She was taken in by a family in Iran and lived with them for 10 years. After the father of that family died, she was informed that she was not his daughter, and not part of the family.  She returned to Iraq to search for her true family and later found out that her true mother and brother were killed by the chemical weapons in the attack.  Her father, who had married another woman and had a new family, refused to bring her into his household.  As the education she received in Iran was fundamentally different than the studies taught in the Kurdish Region, she was required to start high school again.  She is currently pursuing her college education but is suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress.\\n\\n\\n**Proof:**\\n\\n[Aras Abid Akram](https://i.imgur.com/uEMtzZW.jpg) and [Mardin Mahmood Fatah.](https://i.imgur.com/wvIx1w0.jpg)\\n\\nThe [Halabja Chemical Victims Society site](https://www.halabjavictimssociety.org) to learn more about the attack and the lawsuit.\\n\\nAras Abid Akram is featured in [this video](https://youtu.be/LYWerTc79jU) about the attack.\\n\\n[Read a long history of the events](https://www.halabjavictimssociety.org/history) from the HCVS site.\\n\\nLastly, here is an actual link to the Wikipedia page on the attack: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_chemical_attack\\n\\n**Questions will begin to be answered at 12:00 ET.**\\n\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\n\\n**Update/Closing**\\nHey everyone!

I\'d like to spend some time to answer any questions you may have about your resume. \\n\\nGoogle receives more than two million job applications each year. Based on the number of applicants compared to hires, landing a job at Google is more competitive than getting into Harvard.

I\'m  one of the Uyghur People of central Asia, and the Chinese Government has locked up many of my friends and relatives in concentration camps. I\'m trying to help bring the worlds attention to this issue, and to shine light on the horrific human rights abuses happening in Xinjiang. I\'m the founder of the Campaign for Uyghurs, and I\'m a full time activist who travels the world giving talks and connecting with other groups that have suffered from Chinese repression. I\'ve worked with Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo bay and I\'ve raised a family. I\'m currently banned from China because of my political work. Today I\'m being helped out by Uyghur Rally, a group of activists focused on demonstrations and campaigns around these issues in the United States. Ask Me Anything!\\n\\nSince 2015, the Chinese Government has locked up millions of ethnic Uyghurs (and other Muslim minorities) in concentration camps, solely for their ethnic and religious identity. The ethnic homeland of the Uyghurs has become a hyper-militarized police state, with police stations on every block and millions of cameras. Cutting-edge technology is used to maximize the efficiency of this system, with facial recognition and biometric monitoring systems permeating every aspect of life in Xinjiang. This project is being orchestrated by the most senior officials in the Chinese government, and is nothing less than a full blown attempt to effectively eliminate the Uyghur people and culture from the face of the earth. This nightmare represents a profound violation of human rights on an industrial scale not seen since the second world war. They have gone to enormous lengths to hide the extent of this, but recent attention from investigative journalists and activists the eyes of the world have been turned on this atrocity.\\n\\nWhat can you do? - Visit https://uyghurrally.org/ or https://campaignforuyghurs.org/ for more information.\\n\\nPROOF - https://imgur.com/gallery/cjYIAuT\\n\\nPROOF - https://twitter.com/UyghurN/status/1204819096946257920?s=20\\n\\nPROOF - https://campaignforuyghurs.org/leadership/\\n\\nAsk me anything!

Thanks so much Reddit! Well, from Uyghur Rally\\u2019s end, we\\u2019d like to say a few things:\\n\\nFirst of all, we are DEFINITELY not the CIA\\u2026 we are just a group of activists that care a lot about something. Neither is Rushan. Working for the US government in the past doesn\\u2019t make you a spy, and neither does working to end human rights abuses. Fighting big wrongs requires allegiances between activists, nonprofits, and governments\\u2026 that\\u2019s how change happens! So, for those of you who say we are the US government, you can believe that\\u2026 but it\\u2019s not true. \\n\\nWhat is true is that something horrific is happening. There\\u2019s multiple ways of understanding it, and some details are hard to confirm, but there is overwhelming evidence of atrocities happening in XinJiang. This nightmare is real, no matter what the CCP says, and we feel that everyone in the world has a moral responsibility to do something about it. \\n\\nA lot of people have spoken about feeling helpless \\u2013 so what can you do? Here\\u2019s a few things:\\n\\n1) Donate to Uyghur activist organizations \\u2013 Campaign For Uyghurs and others (https://campaignforuyghurs.org/). Support other organizations representing oppressed religious and ethnic minority groups, such as the Rohingya in Bangladesh. Support Free Hong Kong.\\n\\n2) Follow us on social media - @UyghurRally, @Rushan614. Read and share media articles highlighting what\\u2019s going on in XinJiang. Western media has done a good job of covering this, but all over the world it is being highlighted.\\n\\n3) Join our stickering campaign! \\u201cGoogle Uyghur\\u201d. You can print out stickers on our website (https://uyghurrally.org/) and distribute them!\\n\\n4) Boycott Chinese goods manufactured in XinJiang, and avoid companies that do business there or support the technology of repression. Cotton from Xinjiang is a big one, as are Chinese facial recognition/AI companies.\\n\\n5) Contact your government and ask them to do something about it! In the US, this is your senators and your congressmen. There are bills passed and being drafted can do something about this. Other countries around the world are also considering doing something about this, so look into local activist groups and movements within your government to stand up to Chinese oppression.\\n\\n6) Stay active and watch out for propaganda \\u2013 question everything! It\\u2019s nice to see such a robust discussion occur in the comments section here on Reddit. That couldn\\u2019t happen in China. \\n\\nAlso, a last note. The Chinese government is not the Chinese people \\u2013 sinophobia is a real problem in the world. This is one nightmare, and shouldn\\u2019t encourage further global divisions. The only way forward to find a way to be on the same page, and to support people everywhere all over the world. Freedom is a fundamental human right.\\n\\n"Respect and honour all human beings irrespective of their religion, colour, race, sex, language, status, property, birth, profession/job and so on" - Quran 17/70';;;;1576115289.0b'IamA Guy Who Setup a Low-Latency Rural Wireless ISP That Launches in January, AMA!';;;;30112;;;;7etu6x;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7etu6x/iama_guy_who_setup_a_lowlatency_rural_wireless/;;;;2246;;;;b"**My short bio:** I've been married 13 years and have 3 children.

After 2 years of development and betas working closely with a few thousand Redditors to help shape it into the perfect client, I released it in October 2017.\\n\\nThe reception was really amazing, and it\'s now almost at 1.5 million downloads. It\'s been my full-time job for about 4 years now.\\n\\n**Today, 100% of the proceeds from the app will go to the SPCA Animal Shelter in Nova Scotia.** Apollo is free to download and has a Pro/Ultra version you can unlock, so if you get those today the proceeds will completely go to the animal shelter and helping the cats and dogs and bunnies and turtles.\\n\\n**In addition I\'ll donate an extra $0.10 for every comment this thread gets by tomorrow. no spam tho plz**\\n\\nWhy right now?

No knock on the official app (it\'s well done by talented people), but it doesn\'t follow a lot of the iOS design guidelines and feels a little Android-y to me at times. It\'s kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what\'s the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use.

I\\u2019ve been interested in the case since it began, but it wasn\\u2019t until I got a chance to interview both Peter Thiel, Gawker\\u2019s founder Nick Denton, Hulk Hogan, Charles Harder (the lawyer) et al that I felt I could tell the full story. The result is my newest book **[Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)**\\n\\nWhen I started researching the 25,000 pages of legal documents and conducting interviews with all the key players, I learned a lot of the most interesting details of this conspiracy were left out of all previous coverage. Like the fact the secret weapon of the case was a 26 year old man known \\u201cMr. A.\\u201d Or the various legal tactics employed by Peter\\u2019s team. Or Thiel \\u2018fanning the flames\\u2019 of #Gamergate. Sorry I'm getting carried away...\\n\\nI wrote this story because beyond touching on many of our most urgent issues (privacy, media, the power of money), it is a timely reminder that things are rarely as they seem on the surface. Peter would tell me in one of our interviews people look down on conspiracies because we're so cynical we no longer believe in strong claims of human agency or the individual's ability to create change (for good or bad). It's a depressing thought. At the very least, this story is a reminder that that cynicism is premature...or at least naive. \\n\\n*[Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)*  is my eighth book. My past books include *The Obstacle Is The Way, Ego Is The Enemy, The Daily Stoic, Trust Me, I\\u2019m Lying*, and *Growth Hacker Marketing*. Outside writing I run a marketing agency, [Brass Check](http://www.brasscheck.net/), and tend to (way too many) animals on my ranch outside Austin.\\n\\nI\\u2019m excited to be here today and answer whatever reddit has on its mind!\\n\\nEdit: More proof https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/973602965352341504\\n\\n**Edit**: Are you guys having trouble seeing new questions as they come in?

I made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/8cx3w4/basic_income_for_canada_would_cost_43_billion_a/dxipfyr/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=canada) on r/canada on an [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/04/17/basic-income-cost-canada-pbo_a_23413268/) about Universal Basic Income, and how I\'m receiving it as part of a pilot program in Ontario. There were numerous AMA requests, so here I am, happy to oblige.\\n\\nIn this pilot project, a few select cities in Ontario were chosen, where people who met the criteria (namely, if you\'re single and live under $34,000/year or if you\'re a couple living under $48,000) you were eligible to receive a basic income that supplements your current income, up to $1400/month. It was a random lottery. I went to an information session and applied, and they randomly selected two control groups - one group to receive basic income payments, and another that wouldn\'t, but both groups would still be required to fill out surveys regarding their quality of life with or without UBI. I was selected to be in the control group that receives monthly payments. \\n\\nAMA!\\n\\n[Proof here](https://imgur.com/a/rfmOh) \\n\\n\\nEDIT: Holy shit, I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone. Clearly this is a very important, and heated discussion, but one that\'s extremely relevant, and one I\'m glad we\'re having.

A lot of my earlier answers have been that I\'m using the money to buy time to work and build my own career, why is this a bad thing? Are people who are sick and accessing Canada\'s free healthcare leeches and parasites stealing honest taxpayer money? Are people who send their children to publicly funded schools lazy entitled leeches? Also, as a clarification, the BI is supplementing my current income. I\'m not sitting on my ass all day, I already work - so I\'m not receiving the full $1400. I\'m not even receiving $1000/month from this program. It\'s supplementing me to get up to a living wage. And giving me a chance to work and build my career so I won\'t have need for this program eventually. \\n\\nOkay, I hope that clarifies. I\'ll keep on answering questions. RIP my inbox.\\n\\nEDIT 3: I have to leave now for work. I think I\'m going to let this sit.

At a certain point, pregnancy can become risky for both a woman and a child, so we decided to have a child through a surrogate mother. Texas is a very surrogate-friendly state, so I felt safe going through this process.\\n\\nSince my then-husband was a criminal defense attorney by trade, I left the legal papers to him. What I didn\\u2019t know was that for the intended parent to have any legal rights to a child, certain papers must be filed by certain deadlines. But, my then-husband didn\\u2019t file any of those papers for my parental rights. So even though my name was on the birth certificate of my child, I wasn\\u2019t his parent in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nMy husband knew this. But when we started the process of divorce, I had no idea. I found out through the mediation process. I remember my lawyer walking out of the room, and telling me, \\u201cLetitia, I don\\u2019t know how to say this to you, but there\\u2019s nothing you can do. You literally have to walk away, and you\\u2019ll never see him again.\\u201d That was pretty crazy, and pretty soul-crushing to me. The last time I saw Alex was when he was 2 months old.\\n\\nSo, I did the only thing I could think to do: change the law so this could never happen to another intended parent again. It started with me, writing down on a piece of paper what could have been different, so my then husband wouldn\\u2019t have been able to accomplish what he did. But, since I\\u2019m not a lawyer\\u2014I\\u2019m a dentist\\u2014I didn\\u2019t know how to put it in the right legal jargon. So I had a friend help me with that, and together, we took it to the Texas Family Law Foundation, who stood by my side to write legislation to protect the rights of intended parents for surrogate children in the event of a dissolution of marriage. And we got it passed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##This is the reason I got into politics, activism, and advocacy. My nightmare empowered me, in a way. You don\\u2019t need to be a doctor or a lawyer, you just need to be a regular person who has gone through something in their life. We have all experienced injustice and pain, and we can all use that to fuel action to create a better community and country. The key is taking action in whatever you can, and find the avenues where action is possible.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nNow, my best avenue for action is running for Congress. So, I\\u2019m running to represent Texas\\u2019s 22nd congressional district. I will fight as hard as I can for my district as I will for my son, who I will likely never see until he is 18 years old. And there\\u2019s a lot I can do for my district, and a lot I\\u2019ve already done. Here\\u2019s one recent example:\\n\\nRight after Harvey happened, I was sitting in my living room and having a bit of survivor's guilt, watching the devastation unfold all around us. I called around to nearby churches and shelters to see what they were missing\\u2014but they were all full. Nobody was accepting any more materials. And I remembered seeing on TV the stacks and stacks of clothing piled on the tables. It occurred to me\\u2014if your house is flooded and all your possessions destroyed, though you\\u2019re grateful, you realistically don\\u2019t have time or energy to go digging through those mounds. So nobody was taking a thing.\\n\\nI thought, \\u201clet me create something that allows people to have their dignity back, and allows them to shop for clothes instead of dig.\\u201d So, we created the Harvey Relief Boutique in my Pearland office. We accepted donations of clothes, cleaning supplies, and water\\u2014things that people needed. A friend volunteered a gallery space for us to use. We created a store, put everything on hangers, and sorted it all by size. We didn\\u2019t charge for a single thing, but we gave them a dignified way to get the clothes they need in a safe space. In one week, we were able to give away over 1,200 items. I\\u2019m really proud of that.\\n\\nAfter that, we moved all the remaining items back to my office, and then Hurricane Maria happened, which was catastrophic for the US Virgin Islands. One of my sorority sisters was from St. Croix, and I heard through the grapevine that she was packing a container to send to her country. So, we gave her the remaining items, and they all went to St. Croix\\u2014about 1,000 items in all. In two weeks, we supported two American communities\\u2014both my home and a community I\\u2019ve never known, and never visited, but one made up of my fellow Americans.\\n\\nMy point here is not to brag and boast. It\\u2019s just not as hard to make a difference as politicians make it out to be. So when you see things happening your world that are not quite right, that we want to change, you sit down and figure out how you can change it, and then you try to put things into play to change it.  And if we did that as an entire country, then we\\u2019d be in a whole different America right now. We wouldn\\u2019t be talking about uninsured people, we wouldn\\u2019t be caught off guard by four category 4 hurricanes, and we\\u2019d be dealing with climate change\\u2014we\\u2019d be doing something.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n###So please, Ask Me Anything. I\\u2019d appreciate the opportunity to get to know you better, and to let you get to know me. Here are some things I think you should ask about: I\\u2019m a small business owner\\u2014ask me about the vital role small businesses in injecting dollars into our communities or how absurdly difficult it is to get an SBA loan. Ask me about how I think we can get our country to be less discouraged and hopeless. Ask me about surrogacy law (I know it like the back of my hand now). Ask me about how I\\u2019ll support all families, including and especially alternative family models. Of course, you can ask me about anything else too.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMy campaign is endorsed by both [Justice Democrats](http://justicedemocrats.com) (r/JusticeDemocrats) and [Brand New Congress](http://brandnewcongress.org) (r/BrandNewCongress).

I\\u2019m a father, a CEO, an Arizonan, and an author. When I was in college, two of my friends were shot and killed.

We train and deploy rangers to hunt down these smugglers who have killed the majority of game wildlife and attack the local villages. Using aircraft, we support the rangers from above. Though, with the recent accident, along with the constant threat of armed poachers and rebel groups like Kony\'s LRA child army.. we are up against it!!   \\n\\xa0  \\nOur founder first conceived the project in 2012 while he was falsely imprisoned for a massacre he discovered and tried to report! (Link below) In the last 30 years, poaching has driven the elephant population from 60,000 down to only a couple 100! However, In a very short time, Chinko has cleared a 3,000 sq/km "core protection zone" of all activity, & wildlife have seen significant rises. Now, we are trying to expand further into the reserve, which at 17,600 sq/km is almost as big as Kruger national park, and virtually untouched!  \\n\\xa0  \\n\\xa0  \\n***Fundraising***  \\nWith the loss of our ULM, we started this campaign in the hopes to quickly get our operation back up to 100% . The few expats here have spent the majority of the last years in the bush & never tried a crowdfunding medium.

I grew up in northern Virginia, my parents worked in government. I went to George Mason University where I studied business management. I joined Twin Oaks when I was 23 because I lost faith in the underpinnings of capitalism and looking for a better model. I have stayed because over time capitalism hasn\'t looked any better, and its a great place to raise children. While at Twin Oaks, I raised two boys to adulthood, constructed several buildings, managed the building maintenance program, have managed some of the business lines at different times.\\n\\n[Proof this is me](https://imgur.com/9PMIYvv). [A younger photo of me at Twin Oaks.](https://www.twinoaks.org/photo-gallery/people-pets-twinoaks/portraits-oakers-friends?i=w_keenan) [Here is a video interview of me about living at Twin Oaks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzaAmgFS7B4) [Photo of Twin Oaks members at the 50th anniversary.](https://www.twinoaks.org/images/igallery/resized/1701-1800/50thAnniversaryGroupPic_perAaron-1715-3600-1200-100-c.jpg)\\n\\nSome things that make life here different from the mainstream:\\n\\n* The labor system - all work is considered equal, whether you are earning income for the community or not. Cooking/cleaning counts the same as planning the annual budget. Also, you don\'t have to do the same job all week - your day can be a mix of indoor and outdoor work, you have freedom to arrange your day, and you can gain skills in a wide array of tasks and trades.\\n* Non-gender binary, queer and trans people are very welcome at Twin Oaks. People introduce themselves with their pronouns and a significant number of our members go by they/them.\\n* Verbal consent culture is very important here. It is not okay to touch anyone without asking.\\n* Nudity and partial nudity is allowed in some parts of the farm, such as in the sauna, swimming hole, on the hiking trails, etc.\\n* Our social norms prohibit using phones in common areas when other members are present, with the exception of a few cafe-style spaces.\\n* Every day we provide a home-cooked, plant-based lunch and dinner with options for special diets including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and no onions & garlic.\\n* Raising kids here is easier. Some of the time that parents spend raising their children counts towards their labor quota. Many of the kids are home-schooled or "[unschooled](https://www.naturalchild.org/articles/guest/earl_stevens.html)", and they spend more time outside than in front of a screen. The kids have no problem passing the state\'s annual standardized test to move onto the next grade level.\\n* We have a shared clothing resource called Commie Clothes, which is like a free thrift store. Borrow something and then return it dirty, and it gets washed and re-hung up.\\n\\nMore about [Twin Oaks](https://www.twinoaks.org/about-twinoaks-community/welcome):\\n\\nTwin Oaks is an [intentional community](http://www.ic.org/) in rural central Virginia, made up of around 90 adult members and 15 children. Since the community\'s beginning in 1967, our way of life has reflected our values of cooperation, sharing, nonviolence, equality, and ecology.\\n\\nWe do not have a group religion; our beliefs are diverse. We do not have a central leader; we govern ourselves by a form of democracy with responsibility shared among various managers, planners, and committees. We are self-supporting economically, and partly self-sufficient. We are income-sharing. Each member works 42 hours a week in the community\'s business and domestic areas. Each member receives housing, food, healthcare, and personal spending money from the community.\\n\\nWe have open-slots and are accepting applications for new members. All prospective new members must participate in a [three-week visitor program](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/visitor-program). Applicants to join must leave for 30 days after their visit while the community decides on their application.\\n\\nWe offer a $5 tour on Saturdays of the property, starting in March. [More info here.](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/saturday-tours)\\n\\nAsk me anything!\\n\\nTL;DR: Opted out of the rat-race and retired at 23 to live in the woods with a bunch of hippies.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the questions! If you want some photos of the farm, you can check out our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/twinoakscommunity/?hl=en).\\n\\nEDIT2: I\'m answering new, original questions again today. Sort by new and scroll through the trolls to see more of my responses.\\n\\nEDIT3: We DO have food with onion & garlic! At meals, there is the regular food, PLUS alternative options for vegan/vegetarian/no gluten/no onions & garlic.\\n\\nEDIT4: Some of you have been asking if we are a cult. No, we are not. We don\'t have a central leader or common religion. Here are [characteristics](http://cultresearch.org/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/) of cults, FYI.\\n\\nEdit: Yikes!  Did I mention that I am 60?  Reddit is not my native land.  I don\'t understand the hostile, angry and seemingly deliberately obtuse comments on here.  And Soooo many people! \\n\\nAnyway, to the angry crowd: Twin Oaks poses no threat to anyone, we are 100 people out of a country of 330 million?  Twin Oaks reached its current maximum population about 25 years ago, so not growing fast, or at all. Members come and go from Twin Oaks.  There are, my guess is, 800 ex-members of Twin Oaks, so we aren\'t holding on to everyone who joins\\u2014certainly, no one is held against their will.  \\n\\nTwin Oaks is in rural Virginia, but we really aren\'t insular, isolated, gated or scared of the mainstream culture. We have scheduled tours of the whole property. Local government officials, like building inspectors, come to Twin Oaks with some frequency. People at Twin Oaks like to travel and manage to do so. I personally, know lots of people in the area, I am also a runner, so I leave the property probably every day. There are lots of news stories about Twin Oaks over the years.  If you are worried about Twin Oaks, maybe you could go read what the mainstream  (and alternative) media have to say.\\n\\nExcept about equality Twin Oaks is not particularly dogmatic about anything.  (I know some people at Twin Oaks will disagree with that statement.)  Twin Oaks isn\'t really hypocritical about Capitalism, Socialism, or Communism, we just don\'t identify those concepts as something that we are trying to do.  Twin Oaks is not trying to DO Communism, we are trying to live a good life with equally empowered citizens\\u2014which has led us to try to maintain economic parity among members.  Communists also do that. In making decisions in the community I don\'t remember anyone trying to support or oppose an idea due to excess or insufficient Communism, Socialism, or Capitalism. In most practical senses those words aren\'t useful and don\'t mean anything.  So, no need to hammer Twin Oaks for being insufficiently pure, or hypocritical.\\n\\nTwin Oaks is very similar to the Kibbutz in Israel. If anyone has concerns or questions about what would happen if places like Twin Oaks suddenly became much larger and more common, read about the history of the Kibbutz, which may have grown to possibly 1% of the population at their largest?  There was and is no fight with Capitalism from the kibbutz\\u2014or with the State.  My point is\\u2014not a threat.\\n\\nTo the other people who think that the ideas of Twin Oaks are interesting, I want you to know it is possible to live at Twin Oaks (or places like Twin Oaks) and happily live ones entire life.  There is no central, critical failing that makes the idea not work. And plenty of upside. But do lots of research first.  Twin Oaks maintains a massive web site.  (Anyway, it takes a long time to read.)  \\n\\nBut what I would like to see is more people starting more egalitarian, income-sharing communities.  I think that there is a need for a community that is designed and built by families, and who also share income, and provide mutual support with labor and money. If you love this concept, maybe consider gathering together other people and starting your own.\\n\\nIdeologically speaking:\\n\\n\\\\-Ecology: the best response to ecological problems is for humans to use fewer resources.  The easiest way to use fewer resources is to share resources. Living communally vastly cuts down on resource use without reducing quality of life. \\n\\n\\\\-Equality: ideologically speaking, most people accept the idea that all humans have equal rights, but most social structures operate in ways that are fundamentally unequal. If we truly believe in equality then we ought to be willing to put our bodies where our ideology is.  In a truly equal world, the issues of sexism and racism and all other forms of discrimination would, essentially, not exist.\\n\\n\\\\-Democracy: Twin Oaks uses all manner of decision-making models and tools to try to include everyone and to keep people equally empowered.  There is no useful word for this. We do use a majority vote sometimes, as a fallback.  But sometimes we use consensus.  We sometimes use sociocracy (dynamic governance). The word "Isocracy" (decision-making among equals), would be useful to describe Twin Oaks\' decision-making model, but Lev in Australia has written an incomprehensible "definition" on Wikipedia, that he keeps changing back when someone corrects it.\\n\\n\\\\-Happiness: The overarching goal of all ideologies is to make people happy, right?  I mean, isn\'t it? Capitalism is based upon the belief that motivation is crucial to human aspiration and success (and therefore more happiness).  Under Capitalism, equality is a detriment because it hinders motivation  (less fear of failure, or striving for success). Twin Oaks believes that humans are happier when they are equal, and equally empowered. So the place to start up the ladder of happiness is to first make everyone equal.  Well, Twin Oaks is mainly still working on that first step.\\n\\nEDIT5: Some have asked about videos - here are links to documentaries about Twin Oaks by [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7in_Iqnqjo), [VICE](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/have-you-ever-wanted-to-drop-out-of-capitalism/59c55d0ce0c06cfb6eaaa3ef) and [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIvSltuY_k).';;;;1582843382.0b'My boyfriend and I started a business out of his apartment with $2k in savings. 2 years later and we\\u2019ve quit our jobs, moved across the country, and grown the business to 7 figures.

Clear the bearing caps as well, if possible. (monthly)\\n\\n2) Change your belts before they break. This is important to maintain proper tension against the agitator. (~ yearly for "stretch" belts)\\n\\n3) Never use soap when washing any parts of your vacuum, including the outer bag, duct system, agitator, filters, etc. Soap attracts dirt, and is difficult to rinse away thoroughly.\\n\\n* Types of vacs:\\n\\n1) Generally, canister vacs are quieter and more versatile than uprights are. They offer better filtration, long lifespans, and ease of use. They handle bare floors best, and work with rugs and carpets, as well.\\n\\n2) Upright vacuums are used mostly for homes that are entirely carpeted. Many have very powerful motors, great accessories, and are available in a couple of different motor styles. Nothing cleans shag carpeting like the right upright.\\n\\n3) Bagless vacs are available in a few different styles. They rely on filters and a variety of aerodynamic methods to separate the dirt from the air. In general, these machines do not clean or filter as well as bagged vacuums. They suffer from a loss of suction, and tend to clog repeatedly, if the filters are not cleaned or replaced often.\\n\\n4) Bagged vacuums use a disposable bag to collect debris, which acts as your primary filter, before the air reaches the motor, and is replaced when you fill it. Because this first filter is changed, regularly, bagged vacuums tend to provide stronger, more consistent suction.\\n\\nMy last, best piece of advice is to approach a vacuum, like any appliance; Budget for the best one you can get. Buy one with idea you will maintain it, and use it for many years. And, for the love of Dog, do not buy from late-night infomercials or door-to-door salesmen! Stay out of the big-box stores, and visit your local professional who actually knows what they\'re talking about.';;;;1546902449.0b"I am Dr. Buzz Aldrin, back again on reddit.

Check your inbox for an email from PsiOnline with instructions on setting up an account and scheduling your test date.\\n\\n*********** UPDATE September 5 ***********\\n\\nNothing new to provide, just wanted to check in with everybody. So far the only emails that I have heard of going out are rejection letters. I believe the ATO is still processing applicants from the N90 bid that was posted just before the general announcement that most of you applied to. Just keep checking those emails for AT-SA information, and I\\u2019ll update here as soon as I hear of any being received.\\n\\n************* UPDATE August 7 ************\\n\\nI\\u2019m getting a lot of questions from people asking about the delay. I know this process is most likely unlike any other hiring process you have experienced. This will take a while. The standard delay between bid closure and AT-SA emails has been 1-2 months. The delay from application to receiving a class date for the academy can easily take a year longer. Obviously things could go quicker than that, but be prepared to do a lot of waiting. There isn\\u2019t much else for me to update as of now, but I will continue to update this post as the process moves along, as well as answer any DMs. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 30 *************\\n\\nThe bid has closed. The next step will be waiting for the AT-SA email, which could take up to a couple months. In the meantime, [HERE](https://pointsixtyfive.com/xenforo/threads/atsa-compilation.545/) is a comprehensive guide detailing what to expect on the AT-SA. Huge props to those who contributed to it over on pointsixtyfive.com. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 29 *************\\n\\nThe bid will be closing tonight at midnight EST.\\n\\n********* UPDATE July 27 00:01 EST *********\\n\\n[The bid is posted!](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/506307400) \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 26 *************\\n\\nThe day is finally here. The bid will open up at 12:01 EST tonight. Fingers crossed that the site doesn\\u2019t crash. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 24 *************\\n\\n*EDIT 1:55 PM CST*\\n\\nThe July 27 hiring date is confirmed. From the National Air Traffic Controllers Association:\\n\\n\\u201cThe #FAA is accepting applications nationwide beginning July 27 from people interested in becoming air traffic controllers. When the application link is available, NATCA will share it on social media &amp; member communications.\\n\\nApplicants must be U.S. citizens, speak English clearly, and be no older than 30 years of age (with limited exceptions). They must have a combination of three years of education and/or work experience. They are also required to pass a medical examination, security investigation, and FAA air traffic pre-employment tests. Applicants must be willing to work anywhere in the U.S. Agency staffing needs will determine facility assignment.\\n\\nAccepted applicants will be trained at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. Active duty military members must provide documentation certifying that they expect to be discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions no later than 120 days after the date the documentation is signed.\\n\\nVisit www.usajobs.gov to start building your application and www.faa.gov/Jobs for more information.\\u201d\\n\\n*END EDIT*\\n\\n\\nThe July 27 opening date seems to be as set in stone as can be. Supposedly the FAA is shooting for a rough cap of 5,500 applicants, however that number could change. They plan on giving a 24 hour advance notice to CLOSING the bid. If you\\u2019re profile and application isn\\u2019t already as complete as you can make it, I suggest getting it together within the next 2 days. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 23 *************\\n\\nComing through in the clutch once again, u/someguyathq has said that the post date has been pushed to July 27 and the FAA will provide a 24 hour notice prior to the bid going live. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e2wor00?st=JJZ3BI9N&amp;sh=781facd8) to his comment.\\n\\n************** UPDATE July 21 *************\\n\\nI have been waiting to post another update until I had some concrete information, but at this point that is hard to come by. The latest information is that the FAA wants to try to open the bid on July 26 but is still waiting for the all clear from the Department of Transportation. It is not yet known if they plan on capping the number of applications they accept, so plan on first come first serve for the worst case scenario. As always, I will answer any questions and continue to update this thread. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 12 *************\\n\\n*EDIT 5:03 PM CST*\\n\\nAnother user who claims to work at HQ and has given solid information up to this point says that the bid will open the week of July 23. There will be no BQ and the bid will only stay open until they receive the maximum number of applications, which the user says will be around 5-6 thousand. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e22ivd8?st=JJJ3NAK6&amp;sh=602624c2) to his post. \\n\\n*END EDIT*\\n\\nAs you have probably discerned by now, the bid will not be opening this week. The Department of Transportation was supposed to give the all clear this week, but as if this update they have yet to do so. We\\u2019re hoping that it will be posted by the end of this month, but as always nothing is confirmed. Unfortunately this delay is going to be just the first of many long waiting periods as you progress through the hiring process. I will continue to update this post with new information as it comes in, as well as respond to all of the DMs I receive. \\n\\n************** UPDATE July 6 **************\\n\\nThere is a possibility of the bid opening next week minus the Biographical Questionnaire. While this information is unconfirmed, it is believed by people close to the source to be accurate. Of course this could change (as you should be used to by now), but I wanted to give you all an update going into the weekend. Continue to follow this thread and USA Jobs for the most up to date information as I get it.\\n\\n************** UPDATE June 29 *************\\n\\nThe June 27th public hiring announcement has been delayed while the FAA assesses how it will handle the hiring process moving forward. The administration is facing ongoing litigation regarding the Biographical Questionnaire (BQ) portion of the application. There is substantial pressure from the White House, Congress, and the media for the FAA to eliminate the BQ while developing a filtering method that is more effective and equitable for all. There is hope that this can be resolved within a few weeks; however, it could take longer. I will continue to keep this post updated with new information as soon as it is available. \\n\\n************** UPDATE June 27 *************\\n\\n[The FAA has delayed the June 27 public announcement.](https://www.faa.gov/jobs/) I know all of you have been waiting for this day, and I will update this post as soon as I receive some new information.\\n\\n************** UPDATE June 20 *************\\n\\nThere is currently a job posting for new hire ATC Trainees on USA Jobs. This bid will last through June 26. The FAA will use this bid to fill positions at New York TRACON (N90) in Westbury, New York.  *** This is ONLY OPEN to those who live within 50 statute miles of N90. ***\\n\\nIf you meet this criteria and wanted to stay in the NY area, you can apply to this bid. Understand, however, that you will be going to THE busiest airspace in the world. The reason the FAA is offering this direct bid is because the staffing is critical at this facility. This is due to an extremely high washout/burnout rate which is also causing mandatory 6 day work weeks.\\n\\nFrom June 27 through July 2 the FAA will post the vacancy announcement open to ALL U.S. citizens for ALL locations, which is what this thread has been preparing you for. \\n\\nNOTES:\\nUSAJobs now requires applicants to create a new account through login.gov to sign in to USAJobs before they can begin the electronic application. \\n\\n************** UPDATE June 7 **************\\n\\nThe open source bid will be open for applications from JUNE 27 to JULY 2. Pool 2 is for the General Public applicants (you). Once again, you will be applying for the \\u201cAir Traffic Control Specialist Trainee\\u201d position under series 2152.

This is similar to personality tests you can find online. Once you\\u2019ve completed the application, you\\u2019ll have to wait a couple months to find out if you passed the BQ. If you didn\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll have to try again next time they open a hiring bid, which will most likely be next year. If you do pass, you will have to wait another 2-4 months to be scheduled to take the AT-SA. This is an 8 hour aptitude exam that you must pass to continue through the process. If you pass the AT-SA, you will get a Tentative Offer Letter around 2 months after that will include instructions on getting your medical completed, as well as setting up an appointment for a psychological evaluation. Once you\\u2019ve done that and your background check is completed, you\\u2019ll once again have to wait a few months to find out a class date for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. We joke around that the FAA\\u2019s motto is \\u201cHurry up and wait\\u201d, and it\\u2019s pretty much spot on. \\n\\nYou will spend 3-4 months at the academy getting your initial training, the time difference being based on whether you were hired for Terminal (airport towers) or En Route (radar centers). At the end of your training you will take several examinations, which consist of you running simulated air traffic. If you fail, you lose your job. If you pass, you\\u2019ll get a list of facilities to choose from that can be anywhere in the country. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO RELOCATE. Once at your facility, you will continue your training on real traffic at your facility. This can take anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on your skill and the facility. \\n\\nI can\\u2019t stress enough how amazing this job is. You will make anywhere from $70,000 - $180,000 per year, depending on your facility. You will have a pension that will pay you around 40% of your highest 3 year gross pay average for the rest of your life, and a 401k that matches 5% (1 for 1 the first 3%, 1/2 for 1 for the other 2%). Mandatory retirement is at 56, but you can retire at 50 with full benefits. You will earn good vacation time, as well as 13 sick days per year. On any given 8 hour shift you will have anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. The worst part about the schedule is the rotating shift work, but it\\u2019s not that bad. \\n\\nAny other questions, please don\\u2019t hesitate to ask here or PM me. I would love to help as many people get into this field as possible. Most people have no idea that this is even a thing.

I'm Colin Cantwell. Please be patient with me as I am 84 and this is my first time on Reddit.  You may not have heard about me, as I like to keep out of the limelight, but I'm sure you've seen projects I've worked on. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and answering your questions!\\n\\n**A short list of my most favorite experiences are:**\\n* Being accepted to Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural school\\n* Working with NASA to inform the public on the first unmanned space flights\\n* Being Walter Cronkite's \\u201cHal 9000\\u201d NASA connection during live broadcast of the first moon landing\\n* Inventing the first real color monitor for Hewlett Packard\\n* Writing my first book CoreFires - a labor of love 20 years in the making\\n\\n**I've worked on the following movies & shows:**\\n* **Lead star ship designer for Star Wars** - I drew the original designs for the X-Wing, A-Wing, Star Destroyer, TIE Fighter, & Rebel cruisers. I was also the one who designed and sculpted the Death Star and gave it it's trench\\n* **2001, A Space Odyssey** - I worked closely with Stanley Kubrick and persuaded him not to start the movie with a 20 minute conference table discussion\\n* **Buck Rogers in the 25th Century**\\n* **Close Encounters of a Third Kind**\\n* **War Games**\\n\\nI have a deep interest in science - especially quantum physics and space travel. I could not have picked a better time to have been born. So much has happened so quickly! Our dreams of space flight are maturing and I believe one day soon we\\u2019ll be exploring the next waiting wonders of our galaxy.\\n\\n**Two short anecdotes to get us started -**\\nWhen I was a boy, I was diagnosed with TB as well as partial retinal detachment. The cure was to confine me to a dark room with a heavy vest across my chest to prevent coughing fits. I spent nearly TWO YEARS of my childhood immobilized in this dark room. Suffice to say, nothing else could slow me down after that!\\n\\nGeorge Lucas gave me the project of designing a \\u201cDeath Star\\u201d. I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle. It would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and re-fill this depression. So, to save me the labor, I went to George and suggested a trench. He liked the idea so much that it became one of the most iconic moments in the film!\\n\\n----\\nMy latest project is a book series called *CoreFires*. I've made it available for free in the hopes that readers will find in it a sense of wonder and excitement. It's space science fiction of course! You can read the description [here](http://colincantwell.com/books2/)\\n\\nYou can see my original Pre-Star Wars artwork [here](https://colincantwell2.threadless.com)\\nMy book is available for free [here](http://colin-cantwell.com/contest.html)\\nThis also enters you in a contest for a free signed print of my original Pre-Star Wars star ship designs.\\nYou can also get *CoreFires* for free on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/CoreFires-DEATH-Designer-Colin-Cantwell-ebook/dp/B01LYL9IH8/) for the next 3 days\\n\\nI hope that's enough to get us started.

My boyfriend has the rest. He sorts my pills. \\n\\n\\nI used to be the epitome of health and was an athlete living my dreams, until my [accident](https://imgur.com/gallery/SxWEHhA) in 2014, at the age of 17.\\n\\nAfter months of rehab, I recovered almost fully. But, I was left with progressing disabilities, which we were unaware of at the time. Over the years, I\\u2019ve gotten sicker and sicker. I\\u2019ve had many [hospital stays](https://imgur.com/gallery/dgIaVzO). I became completely bedridden about 8 months ago. ([another hospital picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/dgIaVzO))\\n\\nMy whole world consists of this room and doctor appointments. I spend most of the day alone, as my boyfriend works full-time. It\\u2019s incredibly boring and lonely. He is the only person I have interaction with. Some days, I just want to rip my hair out and scream. Thankfully, I spend most of the time asleep. My fatigue is so severe that I sleep ~16-20 hours a day. I\\u2019m going to be receiving a service dog to help me regain my life, which I\\u2019m beyond excited about, but it\\u2019ll probably be 2-3 years before I manage to raise all the funds. I\\u2019m looking forward to the day I can walk again with their aid (among the many other tasks the dog will do to help me).\\n\\nI suffer from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, POTS, Fibromyalgia, Gastroparesis, and cervical spondylosis. We are currently exploring the possibility of simple-partial seizures. \\n\\nMy occipital nerves are damaged, causing occipital neuralgia. It\\u2019s less common sister syndrome to trigeminal neuralgia. They are often considered the most painful condition known, and dubbed \\u201csuicide disease\\u201d, as 1/4 people with them commit suicide. I am being treated with gabapentin and baclofen, but my doctors will not allow me and further pain relief. I admit that I\\u2019d be one of the 1/4 if my family didn\\u2019t place me on \\u201csuicide watch\\u201d some days. If I could leave this bed and drive, I\\u2019d most likely self-medicate with heroin to make the pain stop on my pain flare days. I have no desire to become a drug addict, and I\\u2019m very glad I\\u2019ve never had the chance. \\n\\nI also have PTSD from a severely abusive relationship. This included rape (in any way imaginable), torture, and other horrible things. I may answer questions about that as well, but most of it is blocked. \\n\\nAsk me anything. Don\\u2019t hold back, I\\u2019m bored!! \\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: **My accident**\\nMany people want to know about my accident. I was kicked under the jaw by a horse, thrown back ten feet, and hit the back of my head on a split rail fence. I was seizing before I hit the ground. Paramedics spent half an hour trying to stabilize me (I kept seizing) before they could take me in. The fire chief left his car at the scene so he could come in the ambulance to help the paramedics. I was dying. They told everybody that, so that everyone were aware. They said that if I lived, I\\u2019d be comatose. There was a very slim chance of me waking up, but they said I\\u2019d be severely brain damaged. Yes, I had a helmet on. It saved my life. \\n\\nI woke up later in the ICU. I didn\\u2019t have neurosurgery, like they expected. I had pretty good cognitive function. My only cognitive issues now are caused by brain fog from my other conditions. \\n\\nI want to make it very clear that I\\u2019m not asking for money. I don\\u2019t HAVE to raise a dime. They can do all the fundraising for me. It will just take much longer. \\n\\nEdit: someone keeps posting \\u201cBullsh*t\\u201d in the comments and linking an article written about me a year after the accident. I would just like to point out that it\\u2019s not BS, because... well, it\\u2019s me, lmao. Here is further proof. This is my [facebook](https://m.facebook.com/abby.bedwell?ref=bookmarks). Look at what I posted. Same name as the girl in the article, because that\\u2019s be me. \\n\\nEdit: wow ok this blew up while I was asleep. I\\u2019m trying to answer as many questions and PMs as I can. \\n\\nThank you so much for your support, everyone. \\n\\nEdit: no, I\\u2019m not paralyzed. I do have the ability to stand momentarily and some days can even walk up to ten feet before collapsing. I didn\\u2019t think this information magically made my illnesses fake, but I guess it does to the internet. The more you learn. I post my ups on social media, because people didn\\u2019t like when I posted my downs. I only linked my facebook to prove that my name is the same name from the article people were using to say I stole it from her (me). My reddit history should be more to your satisfaction if you want to see comments about being disabled. \\n\\nYes, I had a service dog. He was too small for mobility. He was for PTSD. He retired in 2016. \\n\\nEdit: I\\u2019d like to clarify that the person naming all my drugs is wrong. I\\u2019m not sure why they tried to name them from a picture.

I found a lump in my right breast when I was 14 and didn't think anything of it. I googled and just blew it off as puberty or something and ignored it. As I got older it grew and eventually was big enough that I could constantly feel it. I went to a urgent care place since I didn't have a primary care physician and they referred me to a breast health center. There they did an ultrasound and did a mammogram. After that they scheduled me for a biopsy in January of 2017.\\n\\nThe biopsy results came back as benign so I figured since I just started a new job I'll wait to get some time off and get it removed. I went to another surgeon (the other one left town and referred me to the new one) in August of 2017 when I had the time and money to get it taken out. On August 17th the doctor told me it was malignant and it was extremely rare for it to have been cancer, especially since I had the lump for so long. He set me up with an oncologist and I had scans and a mastectomy, because the first surgery was just removing the lump not the entire breast. The oncologist told me he didn't know if chemo would be beneficial after the mastectomy since there weren't many cases of it. We decided to go with 4 cycles of chemo to hopefully get rid of any cancer cells left behind after the surgeries.\\n\\nI started chemo November 9th 2017 and it just ended on January 11th 2018.

Luckily, the police were notified and an elaborate sting was set up to catch him, which included them pretty much faking my murder. Two days ago, my ex husband received a ten year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder.\\n\\nIf this looks familiar, I did do an AMA on this a while back, but was advised to take it down since the case wasn't completely settled at the time (posting it at the time was probably pretty stupid of me). Please forgive me if my formatting isn't perfect, I'm usually more of a lurker on Reddit.\\n\\nThis has gotten so much bigger than I ever expected. Please be patient with me, I am trying to answer as many questions as possible, and do so as coherently as possible.\\n\\nEDIT: I see a lot of the same questions being asked in a lot of different places, and I'm really sorry that I haven't explained everything in a way that satisfies everyone. Here are the answers to some of the most repeated questions, for those of you who are getting a bit irate with my ineptitude in the comments:\\n\\n1. No, I do not know anyone named Lambesis.\\n2. Yes, the children are his, they know only a few basic details about what happened, and they are handling it well, all things considered.\\n3. He tried to find a hitman by asking his friends, and one of them tipped off the police.\\n4. No, I was not trying to take any of his money, or even half of it, in the divorce. I only wanted him to leave me alone. \\n5. The warning signs that made me leave in the first place are mostly included among this [list](http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/abuser-tricks)\\n\\nEDIT 2: I just want to thank everyone for reading this and commenting. I've learned that my situation is nowhere near unheard of. Knowing that there are so many others out there who have been through similar things helps a lot. Also, I know a lot of you aren't completely satisfied with the answers that I could give, and I'm sorry that I don't know every detail, or if some details are a little too personal to discuss.

I\\u2019ve been an actress and singer in many other productions as well! I played what Dr. Martin Luther King called, \\u201cthe first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a black woman in television history." Due to my unexpected position as a role model on television for minorities in space, I was asked by NASA to help in a highly effective campaign to recruit minority and female personnel for the space agency. People I recruited include Sally Ride, the first woman in space, Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, and Charles Bolden, the current NASA administrator. \\n\\n(Her friend, Gil, is here actually writing up Nichelle\'s responses).\\n\\nToday, I\\u2019m blessed to be able to spend so much time travelling the country (and the world!)  at comic cons and Star Trek conventions. I\\u2019ve probably met many of you in my travels. \\n\\nI\\u2019m doing something very exciting online. I\\u2019m one of the founding celebrities on a new website called [StarPower](https://www.starpower.co/star/nichellenichols), where stars raise funds for the causes we care about while building closer, long-lasting relationships with our fans. I\\u2019m giving away some of my original Star Trek memorabilia, tickets to upcoming events, and doing some exclusive one-on-ones with fans. I even started hosting my own mini-AMA before someone told me I should do it here! What sets StarPower apart from other sites is that it\\u2019s a monthly subscription rather than a flash-in-the pan. I know from working with non profits in the past that a constant, reliable revenue source is the dream compared to the booms and busts of traditional fundraising. I\\u2019m supporting the [Technology Access Foundation](http://techaccess.org/) and the [Planetary Society](http://planetary.org).\\n\\n* [Enter to win an original Phaser gun here, signed by yours truly!](https://www.starpower.co/posts/37/nichelle-nichols/giveaway)\\n\\n* [Coming to DragonCon?

Welcome to our #SexWorkAMA!** \\n\\nI\\u2019m [Liara Roux](http://aboutliara.com). You may know me - my selfies have ended up on the front page a few times over the years! And you may be familiar with the discussion in the comments under them - many people have been surprised to find out [I\\u2019m a sex worker](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbkv7a/coming-out-as-a-sex-worker-liara-roux-personal-essay) and curious about what that means. \\n\\nFans on here have asked for an AMA about my work - and seems now\\u2019s the time! I didn\\u2019t want to just talk about my personal experiences though. [Our community](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjbkp9/desiree-conference-canceled-fosta-sesta-sex) has been devastated in the wake of a string of [terrible government policies and laws](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpqvz/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking). We already were banned from a lot of internet platforms and it\\u2019s been getting worse - we\\u2019ve tracked over 150 sites and services that don\\u2019t allow sex workers, from PayPal to Skype or even AirBnB, in [a massive 90 page report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit). We\\u2019re worried [another upcoming \\u201ctrafficking\\u201d bill](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/human-trafficking-banking-bill-sex-workers_us_5b045577e4b0740c25e5efd1) will result in many sex workers losing their bank accounts - and that\\u2019s not a fantastical worry; many people including myself have lost bank accounts in the past for being sex workers, regardless of the legality of their specific work.\\n\\nSince stigma about our work and state violence against sex workers keeps many in the closet, it\\u2019s easy for prohibitionist organizations, law enforcement, and politicians to make up stories about our lives. Many cite all advertisements for sex work online as \\u201cinstances of trafficking\\u201d or \\u201csexual exploitation.\\u201d But our real lives are complicated and varied. \\n\\nSome of us do work that\\u2019s criminalized, some don\\u2019t. Some work in person, others make content for stores or work online or on a phone. Some of us work for day to day survival, or have worked under coercion or force, many of us work happily and safely for ourselves. People may be both a victim of prior abuse and now a consensual sex worker. Some of us are lucky to support ourselves, others work hard to support their families. We\\u2019re homeless and own homes. We\\u2019re working class and famous libertines - or sometimes one branded as the other to the public. What you see of us in public is never the whole story.\\n\\n\\nWe\\u2019re coming together as a broader community to push for respect as workers and human beings, and fight for better working conditions and access to the same basic tools and government resources as everyone else. Not everyone loves sex work, but you don\\u2019t need to think something is \\u201cempowering\\u201d to want it to be safer. You don\\u2019t even need to respect their work to believe they deserve human rights.\\n\\nThere are many ways to be a sex worker, and there are also important topics to discuss with regards to safety and abuse in the industry. There are valuable lessons to learn from other countries - many people work in places where full service, in person sex work is legal or decriminalized. There are a lot of people in this fight - and it\\u2019s global. Today I\\u2019ve brought with me some other experts - and put out the invite on social media for more sex workers to join in!\\n\\nThis event had an open call. We\\u2019re not handpicking or gatekeeping, just checking to make sure people are who they say they are. Everyone\\u2019s experiences and words are their own.

For example, you\\u2019ve heard a lot about sex trafficking, something we all work hard to combat - we know how hard the job can be and no one should be forced into it! But a lot of myths and misconceptions about our industry end up hurting us *and* trafficking victims - we all know people who have been hurt or are no longer with us. It\\u2019s also possible for someone to be a survivor of abuse *and* a current sex worker - maybe one who loves their job, maybe one who hates it! But many of the loudest voices in the fight against trafficking are actually faith based organizations who believe the only way to help improve working conditions is to \\u201crescue\\u201d sex workers through arrest.\\n\\nRecently Congress passed a law titled (in the House and Senate) the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act. It sounds great on the surface - no one wants to stop sex trafficking more than sex workers - but the laws don\\u2019t actually do anything for trafficking victims at all! There\\u2019s no additional funding, no direct aid, no new studies, no task forces, not even more money for law enforcement - the only thing the law does is create additional crimes to do with websites \\u201cfacilitating prostitution.\\u201d The [actual text of \\xa7 2421A](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865/text) mentions \\u201cprostitution\\u201d 5 times and coercion or force (until now needed to define something as trafficking) zero times. Since the law hit, we\\u2019ve lost [valuable safety resources and sexual expression has suffered](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit) - Craigslist even took down their personal ads! \\n\\nHere on reddit we [lost forums about sex work](http://reason.com/blog/2018/03/22/reddit-bans-escort-subreddits) as well.

Through the gift of life network in 24 hours we found recipients for 4 of his organs. \\n\\nWhile this was a difficult time for me now and then, I knew my son would have wanted to find something good out of this terrible accident. Initially I thought I would be able to contact the recipients and find out who they were but I misunderstood and we were only able to anonymously write each other after 6 months and only if we both wanted.  \\n\\nI wrote the heart recipient first as that seems to be easier to do.  While I also wrote the kidney and liver recipient only the heart recipient has replied.  We have now exchanged 3 letters. The latest thank you coming a few days ago with a picture of his heartbeat.  I had sent him my sons with the request he send his back so I could have a tattoo made of my sons heart into his heart. \\n\\n Letters I might add that must be void of names and places that could possibly help us find each other.

In Texas I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWr8vkuALwh/?taken-by=theworldwalk), and we\\u2019ve been walking together ever since.  I\\u2019ve been walking for 687 days and have covered 9600 miles over fifteen countries. Currently I\\u2019m in Dublin, about to take on Europe and North Africa.\\n\\nMy previous AMA was a year ago and I was in Macar\\xe1, Ecuador.  From Ecuador I walked through desert for months (and nearly lost my mind), did ayahuasca in the Peruvian jungle, climbed to 15,000 feet to cross the Andes, and stumbled upon the Argentinian Carnival.  After South America I took a ship to Antarctica where I took a plunge in the icy waters and kayaked beside humpbacks.\\n\\nSavannah was four months old when I adopted her.  When she was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart.  Now she\\u2019ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running around at night.  In Central and South America it was fairly easy crossing borders with her.  To get her into Europe we spent a month in New Jersey doing her paperwork (which is easier now than it used to be apparently).  I\\u2019ve spent nearly every minute of every day with her since adopting her.  She\\u2019s my best friend and a great watch dog at night.\\n\\nAs to why I'm walking around the world, I had a friend, Anne Marie, who died at seventeen. I'd never been close to someone who died before. Her death reordered my understanding of the world. I suddenly saw life as something fragile and fleeting. I needed to make the most of the short time I had - I wanted adventure and to see the world. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around stuck in my head. So from seventeen to twenty-six I kept The World Walk my aim. I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility. By twenty-six I had enough saved that if I lived frugally I could walk while still paying off my student loans for two years.\\n\\nHowever, about a month before leaving, the owner of [Philadelphia Sign](http://www.philadelphiasign.com/) reached out to me. He knew Anne Marie and wanted to support my walk. Now, Philadelphia Sign gives me enough money to see this thing through and donates a dollar a mile to AnneMarie\\u2019s scholarship fund.\\nIf you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly blog post.\\n\\n* FB: https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/\\n\\n* Insta: https://www.instagram.com/theworldwalk/\\n\\n* Site: http://theworldwalk.com/\\n\\nIf you\\u2019d like to support the walk check out my patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/theworldwalk\\n\\n\\nAlso, here's an [infographic](http://theworldwalk.com/infographic/) which shows some highlights of my first two years.\\n\\n\\n[**My Proof**](https://ibb.co/dEVNC5)\\n\\n\\nEdit: That's it for me my friends!

I'm a guy who's obsessed with music in a corner of the world that most people never even think about, Indonesia. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and also perhaps the most musically diverse country on the planet, but so much of this music is unknown or unavailable outside the country. My mission is to share this stuff with the world.\\n\\nFor more than four years I've been traveling around Indonesia researching and recording dozens of Indonesian music styles and sharing it all for free on my website, [Aural Archipelago.](http://www.auralarchipelago.com) Without a formal background in ethnomusicology, I've figured it all out as I go: becoming fluent in Indonesian, learning how to do fieldwork, and making connections with musicians and communities across the thousands of islands in the archipelago. I travel with all my gear in a backpack, staying with musicians in their homes, going to remote villages that have never seen foreigners, and finding music that's never been heard outside of these islands. There have been lots of adventures along the way and so, so much great music. \\n\\nA few notes to answer FAQ:\\n\\nHow do I make money?/Is this my job?: This isn't my job. For most of the time I've been doing this I was supporting myself and the project by teaching English full time. My description may have been a bit misleading, I travel often but it is not a constant thing. This is a passion project, but I don't make a living from this. I receive donations on my site occasionally, but these are forwarded to musicians. I now also do occasional work as a fixer and guide for others looking for music in Indonesia.\\n\\nHow did you get into this field?: To be clear, I have no academic background in ethnomusicology. I studied the traditional music called gamelan as an extracurricular in university, then decided to move to Indonesia to teach English and learn more about the gamelan that I'd fallen in love with. Since then everything I know about ethnomusicology I've figured out along the way. It's a fascinating field for anyone interested in music, but for those who want to make it their career (again, this is not my career, just a passion project!), it has the same pitfalls of any other job in academia. \\n\\nDo you pay the musicians?/Aren't you exploiting them?: Yes, I always pay musicians a reasonable fee for performances that I commission. I'm not releasing whole albums of their music for free, just a track or two to get people interested, something the musicians are very much on board with. The idea is that rather than put this music on albums that won't be affordable for everyone (especially Indonesians themselves), the music is available online for everyone, especially Indonesians and people from these communities who couldn't afford a proper album. \\n\\nAsk me anything :) \\n\\n\\n**If you're interested, check out:**\\n\\n**The site:** [**Aural Archipelago**](http://www.auralarchipelago.com)\\n\\n[**Aural Archipelago on Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/auralarchipelago/)\\n\\n**Instagram:** [@auralarchipelago](https://www.instagram.com/auralarchipelago/?hl=en)\\n\\n**YouTube:** [Aural Archipelago on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzMWeyZtWCVU5pzh9JdNhg/videos)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Proof:** https://imgur.com/a/j75Ldii\\n\\nEDIT: Okay guys, it's been fun, but it's late here in Indonesia and I've got to go to sleep. If I have time I'll try to get to the rest of the questions tomorrow. I hope those who are interested will go to the site and maybe fall in love with some of this music just as I have.

I was basically raised as a Jehovah\'s Witness. My wife and her whole family was one as well. I was a congregation elder, which means I held a position of authority in the congregation. I delivered public talks, conducted public Bible studies, spent some time as a secretary (JWs produce a TON of paperwork!), basically ran the whole circus locally. We had aspiration for me to become a circuit overseer, which is the guy who goes from city to city and makes sure all wishes of the Governing Body are implemented in the congregations. On top of that, both me and my wife served as "regular pioneers" for few years, which meant we had to spend ~70 hours preaching every month. This is voluntary, normally JWs don\'t have any required quota for how many hours they have to report. But they have to do it every month to keep being "active".\\n\\nTwo years ago together with my wife we began to wake up from the indoctrination, and then proceeded to help friends and family as well. Unfortunately our families didn\'t respond well to that. Jehovah\'s Witnesses call people who leave their faith and put it in negative light "apostates". They are prohibited from talking, and even from saying "hello" to them, or from reading their blogs, etc. So... our family now refuses to acknowledge us. We have lost them, possibly forever...\\n\\nWe\'ve decided to use our knowledge to help others - to try making people who are still in to see that they are being lied to. I\'ve set up [a website](https://wtsarchive.com) where I publish confidential files that normally are available only to certain people - letters from the HQ to elders, convention videos, old books that are out of print because the doctrine has changed and more. I\'m also an admin of polish Ex-JW forums with 500+ members registered (and growing quickly, 48 registered in this month alone). Most recently I\'ve shot a video for the general public which aims to show their practices in a easy to swallow manner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Hlb1b9SBA\\n\\nAnd that\'s just about it. If that seems interesting to you, **feel free to ask ANYTHING**. I may only refuse to answer some personal details that could identify me, because I don\'t want to formally leave them just yet, as being inside helps me to help others. I will answer questions today for the next 5-6 hours, and if they are any left, then even tomorrow.\\n\\n**Short summary about JWs**: Jehovah\'s Witnesses are an apocalyptic cult started 140 years ago by a guy named Charles Taze Russell.

They prohibit blood transfusions which literally takes people\'s lives.

I settled in South Korea in 2001 and I majored in law at Korea University. My father gave me a dream. This was a difficult dream to bear while under the North Korean regime. He said, "If you leave this wretched country of the Kims and go find your grandfather in the U.S., he\'ll at least educate you." "The dream of studying with blue-eyed friends" was a thought that always made me happy. Enmeshed in this dream, I escaped North Korea all alone without a single relative. This was something my dad had said to my 15-year-old self after having a drink, but this seed of a "dream" became embedded deeply in my mind, and as the years went by, it grew so strongly that I couldn\'t help but bring it to action. I thought carefully about why I wanted this so desperately to risk my life. The words of my father that "changed my consciousness" was "information about the outside world." The genuine solution to the North Korean issue is the "change of consciousness" of the North Korean people. To resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear weapons, there may be different opinions between the Democrat and Republican parties, but despite the change in administration, "information dissemination" in North Korea is a movement that must continuously go on. When looking at issues of Muslim refugees or ISIS that show the appearances of clash of civilizations, the above can be said with even more conviction. In the end, even if a totalitarian regime is removed, if there is no "change in consciousness" of the people as a foundation, diplomatic approaches or military methods to remove a regime are not solutions for the root issue. The change that I experienced through the "information dissemination" that we do to send in USBs or SD cards to North Korea, thus the "change of consciousness" among the North Korean people, must be established first as a foundation. Please refer to the link below to find out more details about our "information dissemination" work.

I am Dr. Michael Colvard and I teamed up a producer from The Simpsons to build a game to help. AMA!";;;;22241;;;;50axy9;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/50axy9/nearly_70_of_americas_kids_read_below_grade_level/;;;;2319;;;;b'**My short bio:** Hello, I am Dr. Michael Colvard, a practicing eye surgeon in Los Angeles. I was born in a small farming town in the South. Though my family didn\'t have much money, I was lucky enough to acquire strong reading skills which allowed me to do well in school and fulfill my goal of practicing medicine. \\n\\nI believe, as I\'m sure we all do, that every child should be able to dream beyond their circumstances and, through education, rise to his or her highest level. A child\'s future should not be determined by the zip code they happen to be born into or who their parents are.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is not the case for many children in America today. The [National Assessment of Reading Progress study](http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading?grade=4) shows year after year that roughly 66% of 4th grade kids read at a level described as "below proficiency." This means that these children lack even the most basic reading skills. Further, data shows that kids who fail to read proficiently by the 4th grade almost never catch up.\\n\\nI am not an educator, but I\'ve seen time and again that many of the best ideas in medicine come from disciplines outside the industry. I approached the challenge of teaching reading through the lens of the neurobiology of how the brain processes language. To paraphrase (and sanitize) Matt Damon in "The Martian", my team and I decided to science the heck out of this.\\n\\n**Why are we doing such a bad job of teaching reading?**\\nOur kids aren\'t learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong. Ironically, the most common method is also the least effective. It is called **"whole word"** reading. **"Whole word"** teaches kids to see an entire word as a single symbol and memorize it. At first, kids are able to memorize many words quickly. Unfortunately, the human brain can only retain about 2000 symbols which children hit around the 3rd grade. This is why many kids seem advanced in early grades but face major challenges as they progress.\\n\\n\\n**The Phoneme Farm method**\\nI teamed up with top early reading specialists, animators, song writers and programmers to build Phoneme Farm. In Phoneme Farm **we start with sounds first**. We teach kids to recognize the individual sounds of language called phonemes (there are 40 in English). Then we teach them to associate these sounds with letters and words. This approach is far more easily understood and effective for kids. It is in use at 40 schools today and growing fast. You can download it free [here for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) or [here for iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) to try it for yourself.\\n\\n**Why I\'m here today**\\nI am here to help frustrated parents understand why their kids may be struggling with reading, and what they can do about it. I can answer questions about the biology of reading, the history of language, how written language is simply a code for spoken language, and how this understanding informs the way we must teach children to read. \\n\\n**My Proof**\\n[Hi Reddit](http://imgur.com/a/Af2EY?reg)\\n\\n**UPDATE**: Thank you all for a great discussion.

My father was drafted into the Romanian Army (then allied with Nazi Germany) in 1942, eventually coming home after the Battle of Stalingrad, only to be drafted again in 1944 but this time by the Red Army after the Russians took the Romanian region of Basarabia. \\n\\nWe were now part of the Soviet Union. I grew up in a house with my Mother and Grandparents. I had a total of 7 brothers and sisters, [3 of whom eventually succumbed to hunger and diseases](http://i.imgur.com/Y36pTR8.jpg) around 1946, when the Soviets started taking all our food to send back to Russia. My Grandpa also died of hunger when he refused to give up his horse. Back then we relied on roots and small rations of soups as everything was for the collective.\\n\\nIn 1956 I finished 7th grade in the local school. I wanted to study, but everything was far away, we had no roads and no chance to reach any other schools so I started learning how to sew from my neighbor in her improvised shop. This unfortunately didn't help our condition as I couldn't earn any money with my skills. \\n\\nOnce Stalin died, a lot of deported men and women where allowed to go back to their homes, and in 1962 I met one of those men, who wanted us to marry. [We did](http://i.imgur.com/IUjsPAP.jpg), but I set a condition: I would only become his wife if I we moved to his village, Cuza-Voda, since they had a high-school and I could study 3 more years. \\n\\nHaving finished high-school, I moved to the capital city of Moldova, Chisinau, to become a pharmacist while my husband studied in the Music Collegium. We eventually moved back Cuza-Voda, [had a daughter](http://i.imgur.com/4psvcLj.jpg) and lived through the Soviet Union, after which our country became the independent Republic of Moldova in 1991. It is indeed weird to see all these countries named in such a small region; now imagine having 3 different identities throughout your life: Romanian, Soviet and Moldovan. \\n\\nMy family was always very patriotic and I'm a big History and Geography fan.

I felt the sun, wind and rain on my face every day. Switching back to right angles and deadlines gave me genuine panic attacks.\\n\\nI spent the following 11 months exhausting my savings and racking up debt so I could go back into the woods and work it out on paper. I took a small tablet and bluetooth keyboard into the forest closest to home and lived by waterfalls and streams again, this time putting it down in a way that makes sense, not just to hikers.  \\n\\nBut... What I also wanted to do, was *entertain*. Too many hiking books are written diary style. *Day 42: 18 miles.

[Proof](http://imgur.com/0kKY9tj).\\n\\nSome pictures of her: http://imgur.com/a/QIHlo\\n\\nShe is a very active women but had a stroke a few months ago. Now she has difficulties to walk and use her right hand (and she loved to write).\\nBefore her story gets lost I thought I document it and an AMA seems like a great way to give young people like me the opprtunity to ask questions.\\nHer experience is very valuable to me, and it would be sad if it just would get lost.\\n\\nShe was born in May 1920, is now 95 years old and lived all her life in a village in the beautiful Black Forest.\\nShe went to board school from 6-14y/o and went to a college of housecraft afterwards, where she took afternoon lessons in office work. She learned shorthand and to write with a typewriter. She got her first job with 17 in a law and collection office. At this time she was also active in the [Bund deutscher M\\xe4dchen (BDM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_German_Girls) and in a girl church group. Leaders from the BDM didn\'t support her role in the church group and wanted that she stops going there, but she refused and was\\ncalled "stubborn".\\n\\nFrom 1939 to 1945 she worked at a company where the wife of the owner and her brother were half jews. But they were the only jews in the village and they didn\'t get imprisoned, because their company was important for the war. They manufactured fabrics for uniforms. In 1944 she got engaged with her first partner. But he had to go into the war. He was missing for 7 years, until she got notice that he died in the war at christmas eve, when Englishman attacked on the 24th december. Her father was also in the war in 1942 as a medic. He then got captured by Russian soldiers and was in war imprisonment for 3 1/2 years. When he came back he was wearing rags and was extremely underweight from starvation and work.\\n\\nHer village was occupied by the French, or to be more exact Moroccans. They were not allowed to leave the house, but she did it anyway and almost got shot.\\n\\nIn 1955 she got engaged to my grandfather. His first wife died during the war in D\\xfcsseldorf because of bombing. When he was in the war, he was in russian war imprisonment and was later transfered to a French prison. He died in 2000 in a car accident.\\n\\nIf you are looking about a topic to ask, she is very proud of the jobs. She always worked and was not a stay-at-home mom.\\n\\n**07:25:50 EDT | 13:25:50 CEST:** we just had lunch. We are now waiting for questions.

He seemed like a decent lawyer and all, but right after I gave him my last payment he tells me that he took a Federal Public defenders position and had to recuse himself from my case.  Yay!  However, he tells me not to worry because he hired a "really good" attorney (second attorney or Attorney #2) who had tried cases like mine many times and will do really well with my "open and shut case".  \\n\\nLong story short, attorney #2 tells me not to worry and that he\'s going to hire experts to refute the claims made by my stepdaughter and my ex-wife and have several of my long term friends testify for me and against my ex in court.  I give #2 copious amounts of financial and phone records to show that my ex was cheating and having multiple affairs, I also give him copious amounts of text messages where my ex was sending me pictures of my stepdaughter (unsolicited BTW) and conversations showing that she obviously knows the allegations are false.  \\n\\nFast forward to the trial and the first day Attorney #2 tells the court that our expert is going to show up the next day and that I have several witnesses to testify on my behalf.  The prosecutor objects because she apparently never received warning that we would have an expert (she knew I had experts and witnesses because Attorney #2 told her in front of me well before the trial, but Attorney #2 never put it in writing).  Regardless the Judge says we can discuss the expert situation when they go over the guys experience before allowing him to testify as an expert. After the trial starts Attorney #2 essentially quits leaving the guy who was supposed to just "help" as second chair to try the case.  The only problem is that I never talked to this guy about the case and he was flying blind.  When we tried to enter my evidence the prosecutor objects because Attorney #2 never turned in any of my information during discovery.  So, in essence this guy never did any of his pre-trial work and we had no proof to back up any of my claims.  When the prosecution rests I know I\'m in trouble because we couldn\'t refute any of the lies they were saying because I had no proof or evidence.  The next day when the defense is supposed to take the stand I find out that my expert never showed up, even though I had paid Attorney #2  for him, and that there wasn\'t going to be anyone other than myself to testify on my behalf.  FUN!\\n\\nWith no evidence on my side it was all a \\u201che said she said\\u201d situation.  The prosecutor did well in making me out to be a bad guy because I made good money but wouldn\'t go see my son (even though she was the one who put a no contact order on me for most of the pretrial time) and that my ex wouldn\'t agree to the visitation since she had moved out of the state after the start of the whole mess.  She also made it out to sound like I never gave my ex money for support, which was a lie as I was giving her over $1200 a month and paying most of her bills to support her and my son, but I couldn\'t prove it because none of my financial records were allow in as evidence.  Anyhow, long story short, with no evidence, no witnesses, and no expert of my side it only took the Jury 4 hours to deliberate and find me guilty.  \\n\\nAfter the trial I found out that Attorney #2 had never paid my "expert" and that was why the guy never showed up. So not only did he lie to me but also lied to the court saying that I had an expert, which he knew I didn\'t since he took my money but never paid the guy.\\n\\nOnce I found this out I immediately fired Attorney #2 and found two good attorneys who I nicknamed \\u201cThe Wonder Twins\\u201d.  I had to essentially sell everything I owned and borrowed money from friends and family to pay "The Wonder Twins".  With their help we were able to place a motion for retrial.  This motion normally happens within a few weeks after trial but because the prosecutor knew that we had enough evidence to say my first trial wasn\'t fair after we had a 6 month continuance on our side they delayed the hearing for another year.  So, after 1.5 years I got back into court and was able to start proving  that Attorney #2 was infective.  However, we never finished the whole brief.  One reason was that even if the Judge were to grant me a new trial I would have to stay locked up for another year at minimum waiting for my new trial to start.  The prosecution wasn\'t about to admit that my ex wife fooled them so they kept offering me plea deals to stop everything from moving forward.  I denied them until they came to one that dropped the nasty sex charge and let me out immediately.  In essence I took a plea for a lesser charge with time served and they let me out.  So, yeah, I am a convicted felon now, but I don\'t have to register or do probation like I would have with the other charge and I get to avoid another trial.  (The felony is going to make finding a job a lot harder but again, I got to come home and get out of prison).  \\nI did find it very ironic that I had to lie under oath and say I committed a crime that I didn\'t do to keep the prosecution from pressing charges on another crime I didn\'t do.  \\nNext week I am pressing felony embezzlement charges on Attorney #2 and plan to push it through.  I have plenty of proof to show he lied to me and to the court about my expert along with many other things.  I also plan to do several bar complaints again him and I\'m going to try the same with the ADA since she knowing lied during my trial and pressed the case forward after receiving proof that it was not true.  I seriously doubt my complaints about the ADAs will go anywhere.  I\'m also going to start the long process of trying to get custody of my son (if he even turns out to be mine after a DNA test), which I haven\'t seen since he was 6 months old.\\n\\nSo, that\'s the very short version of everything.  I am leaving A LOT of stuff out since it\'s too much to put into this AMA.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: My ex lied to the police to keep from losing custody and all the assets she had stolen from me in a divorce.  I got shammed by a crooked attorney who stole my money and didn\'t even do cross during my trial and "forgot" to submit any of my evidence.  I hire new lawyers, take it all back to court and I win to some extent.  Instead of spending 15 years mandatory time I got out in 17 months. I\\u2019m and ex-con but at least I don\\u2019t have to register as a sex offender.\\n\\nEdit #1\\nHere are the links to a few of my legal docs.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/VIrUZUQ\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/D04Jn8S\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/9D89m0t\\n\\nedit #2\\nI\'m not from MS.

I got my first gig in  California as a character rigger working in online games. The first game  I worked on was never announced - it was canceled and I lost my job  along with \\\\~100 other people. Thankfully I managed to get work right  after that on a title that shipped: Marvel Heroes Online.\\n\\nNext  I moved to Boston to work as a sr tech animator on BioShock Infinite. I  had a blast working on this game and the DLCs. I really loved it there!  Unfortunately the studio was closed after we finished the DLC and I  lost my job. My previous studio (The Marvel Heroes Online team) was also  going through a rough patch and would eventually close.\\n\\nSo  I quit AAA for a bit. I got together with a few other devs that were  laid off and we founded a studio to make an indie game called "The Flame  in The Flood." It took us about 2 years to complete that game. It  didn\'t do well at first. We ran out of money and had to do contract work  as a studio... and that is when I sort of hit a low point. I had a  rough time getting excited about anything. I wasn\\u2019t happy, I considered  leaving the industry but I didn\'t know what else I would do with my  life... it was kind of bleak.\\n\\nAbout  2 years ago I started working on a small indie game alone at home. It  was a passion project, and it was the first thing I\'d worked on in a  long time that brought me joy. I became obsessed with it. Over the  course of a year I slowly cut ties with my first indie studio and I  focused full time on developing my indie puzzle game. I thought of it as  my last hurrah before I went out and got a real job somewhere. Last  year when Epic Games announced they were opening a store I contacted  them to show them what I was working on. I asked if they would include  Kine on their storefront and they said yes! They even took it further  and said they would fund the game if I signed on with their store  exclusively. The Epic Store hadn\\u2019t really launched yet and I had no idea  how controversial that would be, so I didn\\u2019t even think twice. With  money I could make a much bigger game. I could port Kine to consoles,  translate it into other languages\\u2026 This was huge! I said yes.\\n\\nLater  today I\'m going to launch Kine. It is going to be on every console (PS4, Switch, Xbox) and  on the Epic Store. It is hard to explain how surreal this feels. I\'ve  launched games before, but nothing like this. Kine truly feels 100%  mine. I\'m having a hard time finding the words to explain what this is  like.\\n\\nAnyways, my game launches in about 4 hours. Everything is automated and I have nothing to do until then except wait. So...

But with the price of oil down 40% in last 3 months of 2018, one of the main drivers of expensive flights is off the table.\\n* **Worldwide economic slowdown is bad in general but probably good for airfare.** Many economists are predicting slower economic growth in 2019 and 2020. When times are tight, discretionary spending like vacations are one of the first items on a family's budget chopping block. Lower demand for plane seats will force the airlines to cut fares in an attempt to woo those travelers back.\\n* **Hawaii flights are going to get even cheaper.** Southwest is set to imminently begin flying from the mainland US to Hawaii (and between Hawaiian islands). Other airlines like Alaska, United, and American have already been dropping their fares in anticipation, but I expect that trend to continue even more in 2019. Plus with free checked bags and free changes/cancellations, many flyers will find Southwest's Hawaii flights especially valuable.\\n* **Mistake fares will continue.** Mistake fares are when an airline or online travel agency like Expedia or Orbitz accidentally offers fares that are *significantly* lower than normal. For instance, the $130 nonstop roundtrip flight from NYC to Milan that jumpstarted my career in cheap flights. Though not common, they show no signs of abating and should give flyers more opportunities at rare deals in 2019.\\n\\n*Proof I\\u2019m me:* [https://imgur.com/a/ArdEc4k](https://imgur.com/a/ArdEc4k)\\n\\n*Proof I\\u2019m a cheap flight expert:* Recent media coverage from [AFAR Magazine](https://www.afar.com/magazine/the-addicting-cheap-flights-newsletter-you-need-to-subscribe-to-right-now), the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/the-frugal-travelers-essential-list-of-budget-travel-hacks/2018/08/01/7f43e210-9048-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html?utm_term=.191b5e62fe9c), [Conde Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/flight-deal-us-to-europe-from-368-round-trip), [Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/08/207760/how-to-find-cheap-flights-deals), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2018/12/14/four-last-minute-flights-under-500-for-new-years-eve-2019/#414365a1680b), [McSweeney\\u2019s](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/scotts-expensive-flights-the-airfare-newsletter-for-terrible-travelers) (in a way) and [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a25396330/how-to-get-cheap-flights/) (don\\u2019t judge cheap flights are big in the tool community)\\n\\nWe send out deals departing every country; here\\u2019s some of the best flights we found in 2018:\\n\\n* SFO / LAX to Asia in \\\\*business class\\\\* for [\\\\~$600](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-16-biz-class-mistake-fare-asia-600s-rt-no-bag-fees-sep-mar-aec1b1536) roundtrip (normally $3,000+)\\n* NYC to Paris / Barcelona / Madrid for [$292](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/09-25-mistake-fare-nyc-to-paris-barcelona-madrid-200s-rt-bags-extra-nov-mar-64dcbcb09) nonstop roundtrip (normally $850+)\\n* Chicago / Dallas / Philly to the US Virgin Islands for [$78](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-14-mistake-fare-us-virgin-islands-68-to-192-rt-bags-extra-aug-jul-ae93a5f3b) roundtrip (normally $550+)\\n* Portland to Tokyo for [$377](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/09-04-mistake-fare-pdx-to-tokyo-377-rt-no-bag-fees-jan-mar-37bb2ac27) roundtrip (normally $1,000+)\\n* London to the Cook Islands for [\\xa3428](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/06-12-london-to-cook-islands-new-zealand-for-40-extra-428-return-no-bag-fees-nov-d46fc5355) return (normally \\xa31,400)\\n* Switzerland to Shanghai for [\\u20ac165](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-20-cities-added-mistake-fare-basel-geneva-to-shanghai-100s-return-no-bag-fees-227f9f3fa) return (normally \\u20ac550)\\n* Australia to SE Asia and Hawaii under [$300 AUD](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/10-24-australia-to-nz-southeast-asia-hawaii-100s-300s-return-bags-extra-02ac24257) return (normally $700+)\\n* Toronto to the Azores for [$473](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/11-26-toronto-to-the-azores-473-cad-rt-no-bag-fees-dec-apr-78785e80b) CAD nonstop roundtrip (normally $1,100)\\n\\nP.S.

Since I\'m a radiologist, I want to show you my proof of all this like doctors show other doctors cases. I\'ve tried to remove the really technical words and replace them with words that everyone will understand. If you\'re a medical person and want to read it in its full, annoying doctor shorthand glory, check out my post in [/r/medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/51o49k/32_yearold_previously_healthy_male_presents_with/). \\n\\n===============\\n\\n\\n**History of present illness:** The patient is a 32 year old male with a history vague and intermittent abdominal pain for the past two years. He has no other significant medical problems. Previously, the pain had been easily controlled with intermittent use of over the counter medications, but in the last couple of weeks had become acutely more painful and the pain became persistently present. On the day of presentation, the pain localized to the right lower quadrant which prompted the emergency room visit.\\n\\n**Past medical/surgical history:** Well controlled high blood pressure. Prior sebaceous cyst and wisdom tooth removals.\\n\\n**Meds/Allergies:** Lisinopril 20 mg daily (blood pressure med). No know drug allergies.\\n\\nOther history non-contributory.\\n\\n**Relevant labs:** Sedementation rate and C-reactive protein, both generalized markers of inflammation, are markedly elevated. Mild low blood counts with hemoglobin (basically, red blood cells) just below the normal cut-off. All other labs normal.\\n\\n==========\\n\\nSome brief information about radiology conventions: we diagnostic radiologists like to pretend we\'re real doctors, so we always "look at the patient" when reading studies. So basically it\'s like we\'re standing at the foot of the patient\'s bed and looking at them, in the same way that if you face someone and look to your left, you\'ll notice that\'s their right. So, functionally, left and right are reversed on our pictures. It starts to make sense after a while (but I now sometimes confuse left and right like a ~~kindergartner~~ 3-year-old. Thanks radiology!)\\n\\nWe also have 3 major planes of imaging: axial, coronal, and sagittal. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words, [so just look at this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e9/6d/aa/e96daae82cf277634d93f43fe0839638.jpg) to understand what I\'m talking about below, if it doesn\'t make sense.\\n\\nAnd so without further ado, here\'s some proof of my shit-tastic disease:\\n\\n=============\\n\\n**Initial CT Scan**\\n\\n1. [Axial CT at the level of the liver](https://imgur.com/UiWFaAL): Right from the get-go, things are looking grossly abnormal. There\'s organized fluid over the liver dome, which suggests it\'s thicker than just some water in the belly. There\'s some ill-defined, hazy shmutz (technical term) along the bottom curve of the stomach which is changing the appearance of the normal intra-abdominal fat. We radiologists say, "fat is your friend" because it looks black on CT. It helps separate out different structures so we can see where exactly something is. When there\'s too much white stuff on the black stuff, it tells us something isn\'t quite right.\\n\\n2. [Axial CT at the level of the kidneys](http://imgur.com/i1xMvKU): More belly fluid and possibly some enlarged/big lymph nodes along the major blood vessels. If you look just "above" the spine (it\'s really in front - think about those imaging planes), that\'s where the blood vessels run and, in general, the lymphatic system runs with the blood vessels. The lymphatic system is basically part of your immune system, so when lymph nodes get big, it means that your immune system is trying to fight something. So that\'s where we look for evidence of disease outside of the primary location it started. It\'s hard to see anything discreet/measurable because everything is kind of smushed together and covered with belly fluid, but there\'s a round, abnormal nodule near or in part of the small intestine.\\n\\n3. [Axial CT upper pelvis](http://imgur.com/CGYs1Ft): The right colon is "jacked up," which is an official medical description. In all seriousness, though, there is a grossly abnormal appearance to the right sided large bowel, the colon, with significant wall thickening. See that big ugly circle thing on the left side of the picture (the radiology right side)? That\'s not normal *at all.* The bowel wall should be very thin, smooth, and uniform. Also, there\'s too much white stuff on the black stuff again in the middle of the belly. Something about it just doesn\'t look right after you\'ve seen a bunch of normal scans and know what it\'s supposed to look like.\\n\\n4. [Axial CT mid-pelvis](http://imgur.com/WuqgxTj): Well, on the plus side, it\'s not appendicitis. That big arrow is pointing to a normal appendix. You may have to take my word for it, though. Again note the abnormal appearance of the colon.\\n\\n5. [Axial CT lower pelvis](http://imgur.com/JbxT192): This picture is lower down in the pelvis. Those big white things on either side are the pelvis bones. All that uniform appearing dark-ish stuff that\'s the same color as what the circle is drawn around is fluid. In a man, pelvic free fluid is never normal and should prompt a search for the underlying cause. In a woman, it\'s normal to see a small amount of free fluid. It\'s related to the menstrual cycle. But even this is way too much pelvic fluid for a woman, too.\\n\\n\\n===============\\n\\nOne thing people, even other doctors, sometimes don\'t understand about radiology is that, we\'re not *directly* looking at jack squat. These pictures are just a really fancy density map of the body. The white parts were where a bunch of x-rays get absorbed. The black parts are where a bunch of x-rays can pass through the tissue without getting absorbed. Everything else is a shade of grey, and we can only tell you, really, about the relative differences in density. \\n\\nSometimes, that means we can make the diagnosis with great confidence. Radiologists call those "aunt minnies," because it\'s so obvious that even your Aunt Minnie can see the finding. But more often than not, things look the same. A lot of diseases from very different categories (i.e., malignancy/cancer versus inflammatory versus autoimmune versus vascular, etc.) can look the same. And so we, as radiologists, try to look at the pictures, evaluate them, and then say what it could be, preferably in order of probability. We call that the differential diagnosis. Other physicians do the exact same thing with people\'s stories and labs. We just do it from the pictures.\\n\\nSo hopefully that will drive home this point: When everybody (the ER, the GI doctors, the surgeons, and the radiologists) looked at the pictures, this was our differential diagnosis: (1) inflammatory bowel disease (things like Crohn\'s or ulcerative colitis) (2) inflammatory bowel disease (3) inflammatory bowel disease (4) something besides inflammatory bowel disease. That is how I would still read a case like this, quite frankly. And it made sense. Those things *fit* with my age and symptoms. I wasn\'t some old guy with a bunch of cancer risk factors. I was actually in okay shape, just overweight according to my BMI (probably just from my huge, arnold-style muscles, duh). I exercised a few times a week. I don\'t think that cancer was even on anybody\'s radar at the time.\\n\\nSo what do you do when they think there\'s something wrong in the colon? They shove a camera up your butt. I got to drink a gallon of what is basically salt water to clean it all out before they could take a look. That stuff is nasty. Anyway, the colonoscopy was... normal. So I thought I was good. We still had that nodule thing up in the small bowel near the stomach, but it\'s not all *that* rare for people to have benign tumors in their GI tract (meaning, the fact that they\'re there and that the grow is not normal, but they won\'t turn into cancer). No one could explain the right colon findings to my satisfaction, but hey - at least I didn\'t have Crohn\'s disease, right! Hooray!\\n\\nWell, we still had that mass in or near the small bowel. They stuck another camera down my throat, through my stomach, into the small bowel. The camera also comes with an ultrasound probe on the end, too (nifty, right?), and so they looked at that thing really close up and were able to take samples of it with a small needle by using the ultrasound pictures to guide them. We sent that off to the lab for the pathologists (the experts in tissue, and the people who are the gold standard test for making any cancer diagnosis). \\n\\nThey also thought the CT scan didn\'t give them enough information, so they decided to get an MRI of the belly too. Just as an aside, CAT scan is like nails on a chalkboard to a radiologist. They\'re "computed tomography" scans. "See Tee scans." When you say CAT scan, [this is what I think of](https://imgur.com/6ZXalUD). And so now you know. And that\'s half the battle, as those important childhood lessons learned from GI Joe remind us all.\\n\\nJust a bit about our radiology tests, too. People think that x-rays are the worst, then CT is better than that, and then MRI is the best of all. I mean, kind of. Really, you use different modalities depending on what question you\'re trying to answer. X-rays are actually still the best first test for a suspected broken bone, for instance. As I said above, CT makes a density map of the body, and that\'s useful for a lot of things, actually, too many to list here. \\n\\nBut MRI is a bit different. In an MRI, we have a really strong, always-on (it\'s a superconducting magnet) magnetic field. It turns out that when you put protons into this field, just-over-half of them will "line up" in the direction of the magnetic field (the other slightly-fewer-than-half face the other way). Once we get everybody "facing the same way," we shoot a radio pulse into the protons. This basically knocks them over, and as they stand back up to face the way they were facing before, they send some radio wave energy back out, and we can listen for that. And the *really* neat trick is that protons stand back up at different rates depending on their environment, so a proton inside of a pathologic lesion is almost certainly going to "look" different than one in normal tissue. So it\'s a lot easier to tell apart tissues of *juuuuuuust* a little bit of difference. Radiologists call this "contrast resolution." \\n\\nAnyway, here\'s what my MRI looked like:\\n\\n=======================\\n\\n**Initial MRI**\\n\\n1. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/F0n1jR4): Since we know what the fat signal is going to be (since we know how fast fat protons "stand back up"), we can send a signal into the scanner at the right time that\'s the exact opposite of the fat signal, and they cancel each other out. This is called "fat suppression." T2-weighted images a basically "fluid sensitive" images. If it\'s really bright on T2, it\'s probably fluid. So this is just proving that the stuff around the liver is fluid. \\n\\n2. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/0dFkebi): The stuff in the pelvis is also fluid. Look how it fills the potential spaces on either side of the urinary bladder. This is bad news bears.\\n\\n3. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5YoolTC): C+ means that these pictures were taken after they gave contrast. Contrast (as is probably obvious from the name) helps you differentiate between tissue types. It\'s generally related to the amount of blood flow to the lesion. Since tumors like to grow, and growing things need nutrients, tumors secrete proteins that tell your body to build new blood vessels to them. So, tumors usually light up after you give people contrast. There\'s an abnormal enhancing lesion along the lesser curvature of the stomach, helpfully demarcated by the measurement tool. Additionally, note the abnormal enhancement around the margin of the spleen along the lining of the abdominal cavity.\\n\\n4. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/AOZZsUt): This is what that small bowel nodule looks like on MRI. It\'s a bit easier to define the margins. It\'s still unclear whether this is inside or outside of the bowel, but it\'s definitely abnormal.\\n\\n5. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/y9G8qsl): Grossly abnormal thickening and enhancement of the right colon. Some of the enhancement along the surface of the abdominal cavity is normal, and some is abnormal. Trying to figure out the difference can be VERY tough on MRI. When you\'re not sure if it\'s normal or abnormal, the diffusion sequences can be very helpful. Self-respecting tumors will generally restrict diffusion, a concept I will explain presently. See below for more info.\\n\\n6. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/cqllFHh): Enhancing nodule or lymph node in the right pelvis. Again, some of the belly surface enhancement is probably abnormal, but it can be difficult to determine how much enhancement is too much.\\n\\n7. [Coronal C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5qEVMpU): Just another picture of the nodule near the stomach/upper small bowel. You can also see the right colon, and the low signal fluid around the liver and spleen.\\n\\n8. [Axial diffusion weighted image](http://imgur.com/FBOVwRG): Okay, so what is diffusion. Well, normally, water molecules are free to move around in the extracellular space. When you have something that causes swelling (edema is the fancy word), there is not only more water present, but it\'s also usually jammed into the cells in the area, and therefore less able to move around. So when we send in those radio pulses and then listen for the echo, water that can\'t move keeps getting more and more energy, and so the signal is higher. Water that gets hit by the radiowave but then moves out of the spot we\'re listening to will have low signal. So it\'s helpful to identify true swelling/edema. This image is at the level of the right colon. All of the high signal in the right colon is abnormal, and we know it\'s not just T2 shine-through because the same area is also dark on the ADC map (T2 shine-through is bright on both).\\n\\n9. [Axial ADC map](http://imgur.com/upjTXi1): Just to confirm the diffusion restriction. If you don\'t understand the whole DWI-ADC map relationship, that\'s okay. It doesn\'t really matter for the story.\\n\\nWell, the biopsy results finally come back. The differential diagnosis for the way the stuff looked under the microscope is read by the pathologists as, "florid mesothelial hyperplasia versus peritoneal mesothelioma." I looked all of this crap up about 15 seconds after I got the phone call from the GI fellow with the results. I had never even heard of it, and I\'m a freaking doctor. When you say, "mesothelioma," everyone thinks (1) asbestos exposure and (2) it\'s a lung cancer (technically, it\'s a cancer of the lining of the lung, but that\'s semantics).\\n\\nWhen taken in conjunction with the MRI findings, this is highly concerning for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. But they still weren\'t 100% sure, so we had to stick some cameras in my belly to take a look. They did that and took a bunch of samples. They were also doing it to see how much disease was in there (I mean, look at those pictures. There\'s some really fucked up shit going on inside me). \\n\\nWe didn\'t think I was a surgical candidate when all of this started. People who can\'t get the surgery and the cancer removed have an abysmal prognosis. Like, 6-18 months type of prognosis. Well fuck. \\n\\nThey have a system to estimate the extent of disease, called the [peritoneal carcinomatosis index](http://www.surgicaloncology.com/gpmindic.htm). It\'s a scale that goes from 0 to 39, and the bigger the number the worse it is. Based on the MRI , my index was 31/39. Almost all of the published literature and studies on this shows that patients above a PCI of ~12-13 don\'t do well. The final tissue diagnosis is malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, epitheliod subtype. \\n\\nAs luck would have it, there happens to be a team of oncologists where I\'m training, both surgical and medical, that specializes in cancers that have spread to the abdominal surface. The team decided to try a two-step surgical approach, that was developed at Columbia in NYC, which has taken people with really bad disease and made their outcomes similar to those of people with lower PCIs. The general idea is this: get the worst of it out with a first debulking surgery. If there\'s anything there that\'s going to make the surgery really hard, or force the surgeon to remove an entire organ that they really kind of don\'t want to take out, they leave it. After the surgery, you do chemotherapy in the abdomen, and then later you go back in for a final surgery where the goal is to take out everything they see. With both of the surgeries, too, they do something called heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The idea is that, you can physically remove the bulky disease you can see, but there are probably microscopic cancer cells you gotta kill too. That\'s what the HIPEC is supposed to do.\\n\\nSo, we go to surgery. They took out my spleen, distal pancreas, gallbladder, right and transverse portions of my colon, all of the omentum (stuff that covers the bowel), and a bunch of the lining along my diaphragms (the muscles that move your lungs) and throughout the belly. It took them 12 hours to do the first surgery and HIPEC. Obviously, this is a huge ordeal and I\'m in the intensive care unit for the first few days after surgery and everything hurts like a motherfucker. I learned during that hospitalization that Dilaudid is my homie. I don\'t know how I would have tolerated the pain without a drug that\'s basically as powerful as heroin. Also, I\'m pretty sure I know how it feels to do heroin, so, thanks for that too, cancer.\\n\\nThey used cisplatin for the HIPEC procedure, and that drug is well-known for being very effective, but also for having the potential to trash your kidneys. I still to this day don\'t know exactly how this happened, but instead of getting just a dose to the inside of my abdomen and a *tiny* bit absorbed by the rest of my body, I get a *fuckton* absorbed by the rest of my body, and it pissed off my kidneys somethin\' *fierce,* as we say in the south.\\n\\nI went into acute kidney failure. They hoped that the injury would hit the peak of its badness and then I\'d start to get better and my kidneys will start working again. It doesn\'t happen. After 4 days of continually worsening renal function, they decide I need dialysis. So we go down to interventional radiology (aka, IR) and they put a [tunneled line exactly like this](https://www.healthqare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vascularaccess-300x275.jpg) into my chest and right sided neck vein. The medical term is a "right internal jugular central venous catheter." To translate from "doctor" to "normal English speech," you need a big honkin\' hose to be able to move enough blood to do dialysis. I ended up being in the hospital for about 10 days all together.\\n\\nI figured I\'d be on dialysis for a few days. Not a good event to have happen, obviously, but ultimately no big deal. Nope, it was way worse than that. I had to be dialized 5 days in a row in the hospital, and then we started doing it "only" three times a week. Even after I was discharged, I was on dialysis for two months until my kidneys recovered enough on their own that things like my electrolyte levels weren\'t getting out of whack anymore. You can die from fatal heart rhythms from having too much potassium in your body, for instance. \\n\\nAnother fun complication I had with all of this was a big ass clot where the catheter was in my vein. This happened maybe 4 days after I was discharged. It shouldn\'t have been a surprise, really. When you start listing the risk factors for blood clots, I had almost all of them: cancer, recent surgery, immobility, indwelling foreign device. My right arm felt tight all day, and then I looked in the mirror and noticed that the right side of my face was swollen. That little spot behind your collar bone where the skin kinda dips down was completely gone. It was puffed out the other way, actually. When I went to the ER, it was such a slam dunk diagnosis that they didn\'t even bother doing anything except starting me on blood thinners.\\n\\nWhen you have blood clots like that, you can\'t wait around for the oral blood thinners to kick in. You have to start people on blood thinners that work right away, most often heparin. Doctors call this "bridging" someone. The thing that sucks about heparin is that there\'s no one dose that\'s great for everyone. You have to give it to people and then check a lab value related to clotting times (the PTT), and adjust the rate of heparin accordingly until you get the person to "their" dose. So basically you gotta get stuck a lot so they can test your blood.\\n\\nI already have a one in a million cancer, but I also found out that day that heparin doesn\'t work on me. They kept giving me more and more and checking the labs all the time and they didn\'t budge, so they had to use a newer, way more expensive drug, and I was going to be in the hospital being "bridged" to the oral blood thinner (warfarin aka Coumadin). You can\'t safely discharge people until the warfarin is at a therapeutic level, so once again I was sitting in the hospital just waiting. Waiting for one freaking number to be above 2. \\n\\nIt took 6 days in the hospital to get there. The hospital is boring as fuck. The food sucks. You see your doctors for 3 minutes a day and then never again until the next day. They talk about you outside your room before they come in, and you can hear them. It was especially annoying for me, because I understood all the things they were talking about. Why wasn\'t I included in the discussion? I\'m both the patient in question *and* a doctor.  \\n\\nThough, you get demoted real fucking fast when you put on that hospital gown. If you have any kind of title you worked hard for, and are proud of - things like captain, reverend, colonel, doctor, professor - and prefer to be addressed by, well, get used to "mister." All of the sudden, I was a "mister." Nurse practitioners fresh out of school (I\'m 9 years down the medical education rabbit hole at this point) with less clinical experience than a third year medical student were calling me "mister." It was then that I realized I had truly become "the patient."\\n\\nBut, time\'s arrow moved, as it does, ever forward, and I finally got out of the hospital. I wasn\'t out of the hospital (for the second time) for more than a day or two before the next fun complication reared its head. There was a spot in my surgical wound which had always been little firmer than the rest of the tissue. Something wasn\'t quite right about it, but it looked okay and I didn\'t have any symptoms. But, on that day, I noticed that my shirt was soaked, and something didn\'t smell particularly good. The dressing of the wound was also soaked. I took it off to look at the wound, and it was pretty clear that it was infected. \\n\\nWe went *back* to the hospital. The surgery resident came and saw me. With big gross infected wounds like that, you can\'t just sew it back up. It will almost certainly get infected and form an abscess if you do that. No, open wounds have to heal by what doctors call "secondary intention" or, as I prefer to say, from the bottom up. You have to keep it open and let the tissue fill into the gap. But obviously you also want to clean it so it doesn\'t get infected again, so you shove wet gauze into it, let it try, then take it out and then repeat the process until it\'s healed. This is a "wet-to-dry" dressing, and every time you take it out, it removes some of the nasty crap from the wound and leaves only the good "beefy red" granulation tissue (what a delightful description, no?) .\\n\\nWhen I say it was big and gross, it was. Actually, I\'m a weird guy (duh, radiologist) so I took pictures of it as it healed. [This is what it looked like the day after we opened it up in the office](https://i.imgur.com/1hPeaxU.jpg). My only regret is that I forgot to include a banana for scale. But, that smaller hole down inside the big hole is actually an opening right into the abdominal cavity. I could have stuck my finger down through that thing and touched my own intestines. I didn\'t, because that seems gross and also like a pretty bad idea, but I *could* have. It took this bad-boy about a month to heal up.\\n\\nAlso, with the open wound on my belly, and the dialysis catheter dangling out of the right side of my chest, I basically couldn\'t take a shower. I would sit on the edge of the tub and wash the important bits (you know what I\'m talking about) and try to keep everything else as dry as possible. I don\'t know about you, but a nice shower in the morning is one of those small pleasures in life (right up there with the pee shivers after holding it in forever). \\n\\nAnd sometimes, you don\'t appreciate things until they\'re gone. I sure as shit didn\'t appreciate things like, "not being in pain all the time" or "not throwing up bile every day because you actually still have your gallbladder." And, quite frankly, my previous good health. I took it as a given. I was only 32 when I was diagnosed. I\'m not supposed to have any serious medical problems at that age. Certainly not something life-threatening. And *certainly* not something that\'s as likely, on a statistical level, as it is to [have a major earthquake on the Hayward fault within the next 50 minutes and other rare things that almost certainly won\'t happen](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/million.html). This is not a go-to diagnosis. This is a, "what the actual fuck" diagnosis.\\n\\n===============\\n\\nI finally thought I was doing better. I felt better. It was 3 months out from the surgery, and my wound had finally closed and I was finally able to eat okay and get calories in me and gain weight. I lost about 25 lbs from this ordeal and to this day I still find it very difficult to eat more than a small meal and put on weight. The silver lining, and perhaps something people might envy, is that I can eat whatever the hell I want and still look pretty good. I eat a ton of garbage food now in an attempt to gain weight. My last 3 dinners have been domino\'s, taco bell, and wendy\'s, for example.  I\'m scared I\'m going to lose a bunch of weight again and look like nothing but skin and bones after the next surgery.\\n\\nBut the fun wasn\'t over yet! Remember how I said we were gonna do intra-abdominal chemo between surgeries? Well, we had started that at this point, and the way we were getting it into the belly was through what we call "ports." You may have heard about those before. They\'re usually used to have permanent, long term IV access in a safe way. They have a long tube that goes basically wherever you want it (vein, belly, whatever) connected to a hub or reservoir that they access with a needle, put in whatever med you\'re using, and then take the needle out. The reservoir is placed under the skin so they don\'t get infected (you access them with sterile technique). [1 picture == 1000 words](http://img.medicalexpo.com/images_me/photo-g/69647-9309172.jpg).\\n\\nAnyway, we placed two, initially. What were the odds that both would fail? Well, as you may be picking up by now, I\'m one lucky motherfucker, because the one that was on the left side just stopped working and really hurt when they would attempt to flush it out with saline. So we stopped using that one. On the right, the stitches holding the reservoir failed, and the port started moving under the skin. Actually, it started tilting forward and pressing out on the skin. It actually really hurt. \\n\\nOne advantage I do have with all this is that I have better access to my doctors than the average bear. I have their work email addresses and pager numbers. So I got in touch and met up with my surgical oncologist. We both looked at it and agreed it needed to be revised, but it was a Friday evening when this took place. We planned on doing it early the next week. Instead, [it eroded through the skin the next day](http://i.imgur.com/lSndrhD.jpg). I got to enjoy that over the weekend.\\n\\nAnd as you might imagine, once that happens it has to come out. And I had no access for the chemo I was supposed to get. So we went back to IR, took out both of the failed ports, and through something of a minor miracle, they were able to successfully place an intra-abdominal port in IR. All of us were skeptical it would work. One thing that happens after just about any belly surgery is that you get scar tissue in the belly. We call them adhesions. They prevent things from moving around as easily as they should, and can sometimes even cause bowel obstructions in people. One of the more common general surgery procedures, actually, is "lysis of adhesions" - they break up the adhesions from a prior surgery if they have to go back in for some reason. But the IR doc was able to sneak the catheter past all of that stuff and got it into position.\\n\\n===========\\n\\nAnd that\'s basically where we\'re at. The most recent port problem happened about a month ago. I had to pack that one, too, but it was a lot smaller than the big wound and healed up in about 3 weeks. This thing really knocked me on my ass at a really inopportune time in my life. My now-wife and I had just gotten engaged on New Year\'s Eve, and I was diagnosed in early March of this year. I actually asked her if she was sure she wanted to "stay in the game" with me, so to speak. I would have understood if the answer was no. Truly I would have. This is fucking up her life almost as much as mine, at this point. But, and this is why I locked that shit down ASAP, my wife is the most amazing person I know. She told me to stop being a ridiculous idiot and that our wedding date was already set, so I\'d better get to planning. \\n\\nShe is without question the love of my life.\\n\\nAnyway, here are some fun stats you might not know about malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: it exists. The incidence is about one in a million. There are about 300 cases of this per year in the US. The average age of diagnosis is about 60. It\'s not as clearly related to asbestos exposure as the pleural variety. People with high PCIs generally don\'t do well, but that\'s often because they\'re not surgical candidates. The single most important factor for survival is the completeness of cytoreduction - if they can get all the disease out, people do better. You can go from a PCI of 39 to 0 with a good surgery.\\n\\nThe epitheliod subtype has the best outcomes (outside of an even more rare cystic variant which is almost always seen in women). There\'s also a sarcomatous variety and a mixed type, both of which do worse.\\n\\n===============\\n\\n\\nI have to take the radiology boards in November and then we go right back to surgery after that. It\'s unclear if I get to keep my stomach; I\'ll find out what they had to do to get rid of all the disease only after I wake up in the ICU. The thing that scares me the most about the next surgery is the possibility of another severe kidney injury which would probably put me on permanent dialysis. I\'m now chronic kidney disease stage III (V is dialysis dependent, so I\'m a bit over halfway there!). But I don\'t really have any underlying risk factors that would continue to degrade my kidney function, so I could do okay for a long time like that without another huge insult. Again, only time will tell. Feeling out of control of your life is very frustrating and scary, particularly for people like doctors who all think we\'re in total control of everything in life. Protip: we\'re not. \\n\\nAfter the second surgery, I should be at a cytoreduction score of 0, meaning they got everything out. At least, that\'s the plan. After that, they want to do more chemo, but this time intravenous/system with a platinum based drug and pemetrexed, a derivative of methotrexate, and the only medicine FDA approved for mesothelioma. \\n\\nOne of the most famous guys in this field, Dr. Sugarbaker (the one in DC, not MD Anderson) put a series of 29 patients on a protocol of cytoreductive surgery, early post-operative intra-abdominal chemo, and then 6 cycles of cisplatin + long term intra-abdominal alimta. They\'re projecting their 10 year survival in those patients to be as high as 73%. I\'m going to push my team to go in the same direction, if they\'ll offer that therapy to me. \\n\\nIt may sound stupidly optimistic, but I think I actually have a shot at a very good outcome. And I also think this has made me a better/more empathetic doctor. I understand now what patients go through. Little things matter to them/us. It\'s nice when people go out of their way to make sure your scan and your appointment are on the same day, for instance. It\'s even more important when you\'re talking to patients who drive 1-2 hours (or more) just to get to the hospital. They really appreciate stuff like that. \\n\\nI learned that I need to go out of my way to introduce myself to people *before* you do a procedure on them. In a training hospital, often, the lower level residents go do the pre-procedure paperwork and the upper level residents just operate or do cases all day. Someone you have never met, whose name you don\'t know, may be sticking their hand (or at least a wire) into your body while you\'re unconscious. I met the surgical oncology fellow, for instance, as I was counting backwards from 10 falling asleep from the anesthesia. You know, that monstrous, 12 hour beast of a case that this whole thing has been about. In my head, I went, "Whatt thhhhhheeee fuuuuu [out]." I will never do a case on someone who doesn\'t know my name, and whose hand haven\'t shaken (well, unless the patient doesn\'t want to shake my hand).\\n\\nI went into radiology specifically to do interventional radiology, but now I\'m absolutely chomping at the bit to get back into the clinical world. I want to drop TACE and Y-90 beads (procedures to treat cancer that has started in or spread to the liver) into all kinds of bad things for people so they can give cancer the big "fuck you." I want to actively do things to help patients, like, all the time now. Not that I was a complete dick before or anything, but after this kind of experience, you just "get it."\\n\\nLastly, it also taught me that there\'s no time like the present to start living your life. I got married to the love of my life a couple weeks ago and we just got back from a super-kickass honeymoon. I plan on continuing to do awesome things with the people who matter until I literally can\'t get out of bed. \\n\\nFuck cancer, and ask me anything!\\n\\n(And [now I will shamelessly plug my scuba diving footage from the aforementioned honeymoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb3OASSR3pg), just like those professors who put the pictures they took on vacation in their powerpoints. I actually worked really hard on it, so please check it out my friends!)\\n\\n**edit:** Proof: https://i.imgur.com/J9poMIv.jpg';;;;1473557571.0b'We make the game Cards Against Humanity.

My name is Roger and in May of 2015, inspired by a trip to a grocery store in China, I decided to start an online business to sell international snacks! Treats delivers a box of snacks from a different country around the world each month straight to your door! The moment of epiphany occurred when I purchased a Choco Pie (it's a Korea chocolate coated marshmallow snack), a snack that loved as a kid, and I remembered thinking \\u201cIt's a real shame most people from outside of Asia will never have a chance to try this.\\u201d\\n\\nAt this point in time I\\u2019d recently quit my job to pursue my dreams of starting a business, so when I got the idea I dove right in. I went to the local ethnic markets around me and bought all the snacks I could find in order to determine if I actually enjoyed eating snacks from other countries. To my relief I did! And with that, it was off to the races. Over a period of three months, from the living room of my apartment (and with about $5000 in savings), I built a website, found a warehouse, and laid the groundwork for the launch of the company. At the end of July 2015 the website was live and the company officially in business!\\n\\nThe business has since grown exponentially and it\\u2019s been an exhilarating experience throughout. During the first six months I felt like I was in a constant fight for survival - to build the company, launch it, and grow fast enough before I ran out of money. To maximize the amount of cash that could put in the business, I put all my personal expenses on my credit card, racking up thousands in debt. I also took on personal and business loans to keep the company afloat as it was growing. \\n\\nThroughout this entire process, I made a ton of mistakes and learned a lot of lessons, and I\\u2019d love to answer any questions you might have about my experiences, business, snacks, or anything!

We offer Impavido to be stocked free of charge in any hospital, accepting payment only once the drug is used. We also offer to replace any expired drug at no charge. When minutes count, we want the drug on hand instead of sitting in a warehouse. In the past, the drug was kept on hand by the CDC in Atlanta and flown out when it was needed. In the case of Jordan Smelski who was a Patient in Orlando, it took 10 hours for the drug to reach him. He passed away 2 hours before the drug reached the hospital. We want to get this into as many Hospitals as we can across the country so that no one has to wait hours again for this lifesaving treatment. \\n\\nSo far only 6 hospitals have taken us up on the offer.\\n\\nAnyways, while I can go on and on, that\\u2019s already a lot of Information so please feel free to AMA! \\n\\nSome News Links: http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-brain-eating-amoeba-florida-hospital-20160823-story.html\\n\\nhttp://www.wftv.com/news/local/pill-that-helps-patients-from-brain-eating-amoeba-not-stocked-in-all-hospitals/428441590\\n\\nhttp://www.fox35orlando.com/home/195152651-story \\n\\n\\n\\n**Proof:** (Hi Reddit!

Example of one of my thief pouters [here](https://v.redd.it/b2pt9v0cbe841).\\n\\nLittle background: Thief pouters have been around for centuries. In the beginning, they were used to steal racing pigeons from others as the birds returned home. \\n\\nThis practice was eventually outlawed, naturally, since no one likes having their stuff stolen. That\'s when thief breeders turned on each other and started (sometimes not so) friendly competitions to see who could capture whose birds. If someone else\'s thief caught your thief, they got to keep it. Those are the rules of the game.\\n\\nAs the hobby spread out to other countries/continents, there were fewer people to compete with, so breeders started practicing what is called "zuritero" - which is where they compete to see who can catch the most feral pigeons. \\n\\nWhile catching ferals lacks some of the excitement of trying to steal other thieves, it does present its own challenges. Ferals are much more wary of people and pigeon lofts than a domestic pigeon would be, so it can be hard for the thieves to actually lure them into the loft. \\n\\nAMA about pigeons, thief pouters, or whatever you want to ask me - related or not.\\n\\nEdit: [Here\'s](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/06/doo-pigeons-flying-scotland/) an article National Geographic did on the hobby in Scotland. It\'s pretty big over there.\\n\\nEdit edit: [Hope this counts as proof?](https://imgur.com/a/w8HKAZM)\\n\\nEdit x3: It\'s late now, the questions are slowing down, and the wife is demanding I get off this ole machine and pay her some attention.

Wooo! Let's have some fun. AMA!";;;;17897;;;;7yp3nr;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7yp3nr/iama_disabled_little_person_who_just_moved_into/;;;;1979;;;;b'**My short bio:** I did an AMA 2 or 3 years ago which made it to the front page, because we just had fun with it. I was answering for 2 solid days and don\'t let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got "sick" at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable "how big is your dick?" questions. Lets have fun. \\n\\nSorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7 Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn\'t accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair\'s ass off.\\n\\nNow the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn\'t reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn\'t have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading /r/raisedbynarcissists and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn\'t in me and I wasn\'t to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb\'s a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I\'m sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I\'m stoned.\\n\\nNow I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn\'t big, in fact it\'s quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it\'s 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can\'t modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it\'s also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don\'t want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don\'t even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don\'t have good ideas. I know I can\'t nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they\'re like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven\'t been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don\'t know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.\\n\\nNow for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn\'t really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)\\n\\nI later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I\'d be 300 by the time I could afford one. http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A\\n\\nEdited out my wishlist\\n\\nThanks for reading this wall of text. \\n\\n**My Proof:** https://i.imgur.com/NUw5ONm.jpg';;;;1519095801.0b'[AMA Request] 7 time Grammy Award winning platinum artist Kendrick Lamar';;;;17893;;;;660oqq;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/660oqq/ama_request_7_time_grammy_award_winning_platinum/;;;;921;;;;b'1.

I won\'t comment on my company policy but I can say I absolutely felt that I was going to get fired for running for office.  I voluntarily asked permission, and that took over one month.  I finally had enough and by the time it reached that point the wheels had been turning for my Congressional race.  I decided that I would rather stand for my belief than worry about my job.  I don\'t want special protection, or leave (though many companies do this).  I don\'t want a guaranteed job if I lose my seat.  I just don\'t believe you should be afraid to run for office in your free time because you could get fired. I absolutely felt that way.  In many states this is legal, and it does happen.  \\n\\nYou should not have to worry about serving your community.  You shouldn\'t have to ask for permission to **run** for office.

Growing up, I saw self-serving politicians selling off the rights to our islands, and I knew that change needed to start at home. So at 23, I ran for the State House against a corporate Democrat and a tea-party millionaire incumbent in what was then a Republican district. They outspent me 10-to-1, but I had the people on my side. I won by a whopping 26 percentage points.\\n\\nAnd I did it through small donations, organizing volunteers, and personally knocking on 15,000 doors. But getting elected is not enough. Progressives need to fight to create lasting change. During my six years in the legislature, we fought to pass marriage equality, raise the minimum wage, expand the world's largest marine monument, levy stricter gun control, regulate Super Pacs, increase taxes on billionaires and set the nation's first 100% renewable energy goal, and more. Now, I\\u2019m taking this energy and record to Congress.\\n\\nMy Congressional campaign is living out the values that mobilized America\\u2019s progressive base in 2016--championing Medicare-for-all, tuition-free college, living wages, the right to organize, strike, and bargain, aggressive climate action, a universal job guarantee, gender equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and an end to reckless wars abroad. And, I will do it without a single dollar of corporate PAC or lobbyist money. That\\u2019s how you know he\\u2019ll never sell out. My values can\\u2019t be bought.\\n\\nOver 2500 small dollar donors have joined our campaign, but we're going to need a lot of help to compete with my corporate opponents.

And if you\'d like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!\\n\\n**A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It\'ll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I\'ve received:**\\n\\n1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there\'s some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a "pro bono" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.\\n2. **How do I get over \\\\[x\\\\] or handle my \\\\[x\\\\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.\\n3. **How do I convince \\\\[x\\\\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you\'re a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot "force" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)\\n4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you\'re interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)\\n5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it\'s a group of people who have been wanting the space. I\'m truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it\'s something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It\'s something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.\\n6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple & family therapist is my recommendation. If you\'re interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!\\n7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick\'s and others\' writings about video gaming?** I don\'t have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel\'s Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It\'s also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.\\n8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you\'d like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!\\n\\nUnfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I\'ve received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It\'s for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don\'t feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.\\n\\nI\'m still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you\'d like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I\'m on (pretty much) every night!\\n\\nThank you all for showing how much this matters.

I have had 19 brain surgeries so far and have a valve in my head that controls the flow rate of my spinal fluid. AMA!';;;;17319;;;;6t9s78;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6t9s78/iama_31_year_old_female_with_hydrocephalus_i_have/;;;;1650;;;;b'**My short bio:** \\n\\nI was born with a condition called Hydrocephalus (commonly known as "water on the brain") where spinal fluid  builds up in the ventricles of the brain. I have a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) programmable shunt to re-route the excess fluid to organ tissue in my abdomen to be reabsorbed naturally. The "programmable" part is a valve in my head (outside of my skull, but under the skin) that can change the flow rate of my spinal fluid using magnets and without invasive surgery. However, my valve is stuck so the next time something goes wrong, I will need surgery again.\\n\\nI have had this since birth and, due to complications, I have had 19 brain surgeries to date. There will likely be more in the future, but so far I have been surgery free for 5 years. \\n\\nI wanted to do this AMA to raise awareness for Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common birth defect, but hardly is talked about and does not get the funding for research that it truly needs. 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 births result in Hydrocephalus; that\'s as common as down syndrome. Despite being a condition that has been acknowledged since 2500 BC, there was no treatment until 1952 AD. People often died of untreated hydrocephalus. Very few advancements have been made since the 1950s.\\n\\nIf you want to find out more, either ask me here or check out the [Hydrocephalus Association](http://www.hydroassoc.org/); it is a great resource.\\n\\n**My proof:**\\nProof was submitted privately, but [here\'s a picture I will share of my shunt being adjusted!](http://imgur.com/QhzjhxT)\\n\\nEdit: Wow!

It looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DCtgRkrF40) and it sits just outside of my skull and under the skin.\\n\\nEdit 3: Wow! This blew up bigger than I could have imagined!

Please keep in mind that my answers are about *my* experiences and should not be taken over the advice of your neurosurgeon. \\n\\nTo those of you asking about drinking water: When your brain is in distress, your body begins to dump sodium to protect it. If your sodium levels get too low, it\'s life threatening. To combat that, often doctors will prescribe salt pills and limit water intake. However, if your shunt is working fine, your brain isn\'t in distress and it\'s a moot point. Do not alter your water intake because of something you saw here, follow your neurosurgeon\'s advice. For me, I just hate the taste.\\n\\nThank you, everyone, for your responses.';;;;1502588428.0b'iAMa Waffle House Waitress AMA!';;;;17283;;;;4vcrn6;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4vcrn6/iama_waffle_house_waitress_ama/;;;;6914;;;;b"http://imgur.com/T3en8yE\\n\\nWell, I've noticed some others doing this but a whole lot of shenanigans go down at the Waffle House late at night.\\n\\n>My responses may slow down a bit guys but I'll still answer some off an on!  \\n\\n\\n/u/Waffle_Ambasador is hosting a iAmA as well!

I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) "following" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn\'t be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I\'ve had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my "[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously "[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUsing all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying.  Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I  [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it\'s a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAsk me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing & selling art, or whatever\'s on your mind. I\'ll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn\'t be here without you!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Hey guys and gals, this has been a boat load of fun but I\'ve got to get back to work for a bit. Please feel free to keep firing the questions and I\'ll answer as many as I can later this evening. Thanks again Reddit, I love you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPS: No, not related to Bill Cosby. No, you can\'t run in my lobby. And yes, this is classic Schmosby right here.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit 2 - 9/6/2018: Just one more edit. I want to say thank you so much for the Reddit Gold to the two of you who sent it my way! I was up late last night trying to reply to as many comments as possible, and I\'ll get through even more of them today, and thank you to all the commentors as well. If I don\'t reply to your specific question by the end of the day today it probably means that it was answered multiple times elsewhere in the thread, so poke around a bit, or feel free to shoot me a pm once my inbox cools off.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I\'ve mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron\'s line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there\'s another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to "stack" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat being said, when you\'re first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site!  Google the "Rule of 500" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they\'ll still be cool and it\'s great practice!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you\'re just getting into astro landscape photography, it\'s much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I\'ll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you\'ll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat\'s all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!';;;;1536195449.0b'I am Aisha Tyler and I have all the jobs.

A full explanation can be found [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/), but the gist of it is that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from Reddit and the admins did not have a good alternative to help conduct AMAs. As a result, our current system will no longer be feasible. \\n\\nChooter (Victoria) was let go as an admin by /u/kn0thing.  She was a pillar of the AMA community and responsible for nearly all of reddit\'s positive press.  She helped not only IAMA grow, but reddit as a whole.  reddit\'s culture would not be what it is today without Victoria\'s efforts over the last several years.\\n\\nWe have taken the day to try to understand how Reddit will seek to replace Victoria, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that they do not have a plan that we can put our trust in. The admins have refused to provide essential information about arranging and scheduling AMAs with their new \'team.\' This does not bode well for future communication between us, and we cannot be sure that everything is being arranged honestly and in accordance with our rules. The information we have requested is essential to ensure that money is not changing hands at any point in the procedure which is necessary for /r/IAmA to remain equal and egalitarian. As a result, we will no longer be working with the admins to put together AMAs. Anyone seeking to schedule an AMA can simply message the moderators or email us at AMAVerify@gmail.com, and we\'d be happy to assist and help prepare them for the AMA in any way. We will also be making some future changes to our requirements to cope with Victoria\'s absence. Most of these will be behind-the-scenes tweaks to how we help arrange AMAs beforehand, but if there are any rule changes we will let you all know in a sticky post.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe\'d like to take this moment to thank Victoria for all of her work on thousands of AMAs. Her cheerfulness, attitude, work ethic, and so many other attributes made her the perfect person for this job. We mods truly feel that she is irreplaceable. Thanks for everything, /u/Chooter, and we wish you the best of luck going forward.\\n\\nThank you all for your patience during this debacle (and for the hundreds of messages of support!), and we hope to have many interesting AMAs for you all in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions in the comments below! Additionally, a former admin has asked to do an AMA about his experiences with Reddit, and you can ask him questions about the inner workings of the site as soon as his AMA goes live [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0idl/i_am_dacvak_former_reddit_employee_and_leukemia/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nEdit July 5, 2015 - Alexis Ohanian (/u/kn0thing) has been working with us over the weekend to institute new protocols for how reddit, inc. will work with the mods of communities looking to hosts AMAs (including, but limited to r/IAmA). The goal is to create a much more \'hands off\' system regarding the scheduling and facilitation of AMAs. He has described the team of existing admins in charge of funneling AMAs to the right mods for scheduling in the interim. This team will be replaced by a full time employee in the future.\\n\\nHe has also described the new team in charge facilitating AMAs and some of their broader objectives concerning integrating talent as consistent posters rather than one off occurrences. This more relates to the site as a whole rather than how /r/IamA functions day to day.  While we\'re still unhappy with how this transition occurred, it would be unfair for us not to publicly recognize the recent efforts on the part of the site administration to \'make it right\'.';;;;1435973101.0b'I am Justin Lehmiller, a Research Fellow at The Kinsey Institute who conducted the largest survey of sexual fantasies in America and just wrote a book about it.

You can find the first AMA [HERE](https://amp.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/apxlfk/im_ethan_an_18_year_old_who_made_national/)\\n\\nMy first AMA was addressing how my story blew up, and the strange place I was in with the news cycle placing attention on myself and my family. That\\u2019s a completely different situation than this senate hearing, and I figured we could address some of your questions in this post. So send them my way and I\\u2019ll try to answer as many as I can! \\n\\nAlso, [HERES](https://imgur.com/gallery/7gNLS4p) a picture from the testimony in my very dapper suit.\\n\\nEdit: for those that don\\u2019t know what this is all about, I made a Reddit post a few months ago that blew up.

AMA.';;;;16337;;;;3pxrfr;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3pxrfr/i_am_chris_hadfield_ama/;;;;2143;;;;b'Hello reddit!\\n\\nIt has been almost two years since my last AMA, and I think with all I\'ve had happen in the past little while it would be nice to take some time to come back and chat. The previous AMAs can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1s4l7v/i_am_col_chris_hadfield_retired_astronaut/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dhovl/hi_from_orbit_reddit_i_helped_canada_unveil_its/). If I\'m unable to get to your question today, there\'s a chance that you\'ll be able to find my responses there.\\n \\nBefore our conversation, I\\u2019d like to highlight three things that I\'ve been up to recently, as they might be of interest to you.\\n\\nThe first is [Generator](http://www.generatorevent.com/) ([fb event](https://www.facebook.com/events/712627588883618/)). Happening on the 28th (in 5 days) at Toronto\'s historic Massey Hall, it is a blend of comedy, science and music in the style of Brian Cox and Robin Ince\'s yearly event at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The intent is to create a space for incredible, esoteric ideas and performers to reach a mainstream audience. For example, Marshall Jones\' slam poem [Touchscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFX2LrNE3VI) is undeniably fascinating, but through an uncommon medium that makes seeing it inaccessible. I want Toronto to have a platform where performers can meet a large audience more interested in their message than their medium. It isn\\u2019t a show that is easy to describe, but I think it will be one that is memorable. While I wouldn\'t call it a charity event in the way that term is often used, the proceeds from the show will be going to local non-profits that are making definitive, positive change. If you\'re in the area, we\'d love to have you there. The more people come out, the stronger we can make it in the future. I\'m really looking forward to it.\\n \\nThe second is my recent album, [Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can](http://chrishadfield.ca/music/), of which I am immensely proud. The vocals and guitar were recorded in my sleeping pod on station, and then later mixed with a complement of talented artists here on Earth. The final music video of the album, from the song Beyond the Terra, will be released in the coming days. My proceeds from the album will be going to support youth music education in Canada.\\n\\nThe third is my upcoming animated science-comedy series, "It\'s Not Rocket Science", which will be a released on YouTube and is aimed at changing the talking points on a number of contentious public views of scientific concepts. For example, encouraging vaccination by explaining smallpox, not vaccines, or explaining climate change via the Aral Sea, rather than CO2. While it is still in production, we have set up a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/notrocketscience?ty=h) to provide background updates to how things are progressing with the talented group making it a reality, as well as helping to cover the costs of keeping it free to view.\\n \\nWith that said - ask me anything!';;;;1445653905.0b'I am Idris Elba, AMA!';;;;16323;;;;2gvrak;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2gvrak/i_am_idris_elba_ama/;;;;2920;;;;b'I\'m an actor, I\'ve been an actor for a long time, I\'ve come from England, I like to deejay, and that\'s it.

I\'m a 911 dispatcher here to welcome your questions, provide insight, and hopefully gain a little visibility for a profession that usually only enters the public eye when we screw up! \\n\\nI work in a PSAP (Public Safety Access/Answering Point) meaning that we dispatch for every agency in my county, which includes Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, and other agencies. My center specifically handles calls and radio dispatch for the County Sheriff, local Police, 10 separate Fire Departments, the Forestry Service, EMS, the local Rescue Squad/independant first responders, State Parks, and Animal Control! \\n\\nAsk away!\\n\\n\\n**********EDIT******************\\n\\nThank you, everyone, for your support, your time, and your questions! I have to sign off for a bit, but I promise I will return and try to answer everything that\'s been asked!\\n\\nCall us if you need us!\\n\\n*************EDIT #2************************************************\\n\\n**Here are answers to some common questions!**\\n\\n**1) When should I call 911?**\\n\\nAny time you believe yourself or someone else to be in danger, or if you are in a situation that you cannot handle on your own, please do not hesitate to call! We would always rather you call and we send someone out and it end up being a non-emergency, than you hesitate and something bad happen. Call!\\n\\n**2) How do I get a job as a dispatcher?**\\n\\nOur center does not require any kind of degree beyond a high school diploma. I personally just found a job posting on my County\'s website and applied! The next step is a skills/aptitude test which will test your typing speed (at least 35 words/minute), your reading comprehension, listening skills, and your ability to multitask. If you pass this, then you usually will have a panel interview with several people from the dispatch center, which is honestly just about like every other interview I\'ve ever had. The questions are fairly generic, they\'re mainly looking for clear communication, and a background in customer service is a plus since that\'s essentially what you\'re doing, serving the public. After you get hired, you\'ll be trained very thoroughly, certified in every area the center requires, and then start your probationary period (mine was six months).\\n\\n**3) Can you trace a call?**\\n\\nYes and no, essentially. \\n**Landline calls** will usually give us a reliable physical address. **Cell Phone calls** will usually give us a GPS location on our map that\'s accurate within about 30 yards. **VOIP calls** function mostly like landline calls on our end, but have less accuracy on average. That said, all of these can and do fail from time to time, so it is always best to tell us your location!\\n\\n**4) What\'s the most important information to tell 911 when I call?**\\n\\nLocation! **Location!!** LOCATION!!!!\\n\\nIf we know nothing else, your location will let us send help and we can go from there! Yes, we would love to know what is going on in the situation, but as soon as we get your location we can start sending help, so please tell us that first, and then while someone else is dispatching responders, the call taker will try to get the rest of that information and let the units know as we go\\n\\n**5) What happens if someone calls and hangs up, or says nothing, or is unable to speak to the dispatcher due to the situation/a dangerous person in the room?**\\n\\nEvery center has different policies about this. For a call where someone calls and just immediately hangs up, my center will still send an officer to check it out because we have the time and resources to do so. Other centers will not send anyone if they don\'t hear signs of distress. For a call where the call is connected but you don\'t say anything (called an "open line"), we will listen as long as we can and try to hear voices or noises that could tell us what\'s going on, then act accordingly. Do we hear yelling or arguing? Gun shots? A car radio playing like you butt-dialed in the car? \\n**For callers who have called and cannot answer questions because there is someone dangerous nearby** We will try to get you to somehow answer yes or no questions if possible, but if you are in that situation and cannot say anything, **try and set the phone down discreetly and just let us listen to what\'s going on**. We may be able to hear enough to know what\'s going on, but if no sounds of distress are heard, then again it\'s up to the center\'s policy as to whether an officer is sent or not. I wish that every center could send an officer to every open line/hang up call that comes in, but it just isn\'t feasible even though we will try our best to figure out what is going on.\\n\\n************************EDIT#3************************************************\\nGold and front page!

I track oil tankers at sea, deal with whistle blowers, research Standard Oil, and have gone undercover at industry conferences. AMA!';;;;15645;;;;7nq4m5;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7nq4m5/i_investigate_oil_companies_that_manipulate/;;;;1025;;;;b'**My short bio:** My name is Cody Rosenfield, I have been investigating oil market manipulation since early 2015. Oil companies use price manipulation to target specific regions and make arguments against environmental protections. For example, oil companies routinely manipulate California oil prices \\u2013 then claim that it is California\\u2019s clean energy rules that force the prices to be so high. My work is to reveal the manipulation and curtail this false argument.\\n\\nIn 2017 I left the organization I spent three years at in order to try and look at other markets besides California. I\\u2019ve spent the last 9 months looking at the United States oil markets, and seeing if I could start an organization to focus solely on oil price manipulation issues. The data is incredibly expensive (just buying historical data for a few specific types of crude oil costs nearly $3,000).\\n\\nI didn\'t secure funding, and I\\u2019m starting a new job in a week that I\'m very excited about that has to do with oil/energy issues.\\n\\nMy work was initially focused in California, which is the 3rd largest gasoline market in the world after the United States as a whole, and China.\\n\\nI was introduced to the work when ExxonMobil\\u2019s refinery in Torrance, California suffered a massive explosion in February of 2015. The refinery stayed offline for a year and a half \\u2013 causing a huge price crisis in California. Californians were paying $1.50 more per gallon of gasoline than the national average. Californians paid billions more at the pump due to the shortage perpetrated by ExxonMobil and their allies. \\n\\nExxonMobil sold the refinery in mid-2016, and the new owner\\u2019s CEO stated publicly that he believed ExxonMobil purposely kept the refinery offline.\\n\\nI was shocked at how little research was going into the issue, and how no law enforcement agency was taking responsibility for trying these cases. There are specific laws/rules by the Federal Trade Commission regarding oil price manipulation, but the FTC has NEVER utilized the rules to try a company. Americans have spent nearly $6 trillion on gasoline since 2000, and there are essentially no regulators paying attention.\\n\\n\\nI was urged to do this AMA by r/MechanicalKeyboard, after I posted the keyboard that I use to track ships at sea carrying oil. See that post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7nnizc/i_use_this_to_track_oil_tankers_at_sea_watching/\\n\\n\\n**My Proof:** https://twitter.com/CodyRosenfield/status/948325300638597120\\n\\n**NEW PROOF** https://imgur.com/1Pipfbq\\n\\n**HOW TO GET INVOLVED** A lot of people are asking if they can help out/volunteer in some way. If you\'re interested, send me a pm, and what you\'re interested in doing and I will try and respond to everyone.\\n\\n**UPDATE** Thanks everybody for your interest. I will be answering further questions first thing tomorrow morning. \\n\\n**EDIT 9:02 PST** This has grown quite a bit overnight. I\'m going to answer some more questions this morning, and I really appreciate everyone\'s interest.\\n\\n**COMMON QUESTION**: Lots of people are asking about whether oil companies can charge whatever price they want. This is true only when it comes to sales from oil companies to consumers. A gas station can charge you *any* price it likes. On the other hand there are substantive rules about trades between oil companies, and sales from oil companies *to* gas stations. These wholesale trades are regulated, but the government rarely pursues them. If you want to learn about rules regarding oil product trades, the best place to start is this FTC guide, which shows there are strict rules, but they are rarely enforced: https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/rules/prohibition-energy-market-manipulation-rule/091113mmrguide.pdf\\n\\n**pbf ceo saying ExxonMobil kept refinery offline** Here is the direct quote from Tom Nimbley, the CEO of PBF Energy on the second quarter 2016 investor call: \\n\\n"As I look at Torrance, this is a facility that has somewhat under black clouds for a period of time because Exxon, I personally believe Exxon probably had made decision that they were not going to run a single refinery operation in the state of California."\\n\\nHere is the transcript, with full context, from Seeking Alpha:https://seekingalpha.com/article/3993336-pbf-energy-pbf-ceo-tom-nimbley-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\\n\\n**FINAL EDIT 1:35 PST 1/3/18** Thank you all for this journey and ongoing conversation. I\\u2019ve answered all the questions I\\u2019m going to be able to. ***If people are still interested in getting involved, please send me a PM*** \\u2013 I will try and respond to everyone, and I\'ll try find a way to connect people to create a strong network. All from across the world are welcome - this issue is prevalent almost everywhere.\\n\\nTo stay up to date on my work, follow me on Twitter, where I will be more active in the coming year. Otherwise, keep an ear and an eye open for gasoline or oil price manipulation in the news, and check it out if you see it. I\\u2019ll do my best to post news stories or any updates on the issue.

In the more extreme cases, the dent can push on one\\u2019s heart and lungs, causing issues for the person (especially as they grow old and their heart and lungs grow weaker). Pectus Excavatum can also cause back issues and posture issues for some. Many people also seek out surgery for cosmetic reasons. \\n\\nThe look of one\\u2019s Pectus Excavatum can be reduced through different physical exercises, which can take a long time and much effort. The main method of surgical treatment is the Nuss procedure. During this procedure, two incisions are made on both sides of the chest, near the ribs. From there, curved metal bars are inserted into the chest to raise the chest wall and create room for the heart and lungs to function properly. Anywhere from 1 to 3 bars can be inserted depending on the height of the person. \\n\\n\\nOK, now for my personal experience. I first noticed something was wrong during my freshman year of high school. I always knew I had a small dent in my chest, but I just assumed it was insignificant and chalked it up to me being skinny and having small pecs. However, during my Physical Education class, I started to see my shirtless classmates in the locker room, and I realized that no one else\\u2019s chest looked like mine did. I hit my first big growth spurt between my freshman and sophomore years, which only caused my chest hole to grow deeper. This is when some of my classmates started to point it out to me. [I have some funny stories about this if you\\u2019d like to hear :)]  I still just assumed it was a byproduct of being tall and skinny (I was 6\\u201d1\\u2019 and 130 lbs. at the time). I searched \\u201cchest dent\\u201d on Google, and that was the first time I discovered what Pectus Excavatum was and realized something may have been wrong. \\n\\nAbout 6 months later, during a yearly physical with my doctor, he noticed my chest and asked me about it. Eventually, this led to him contacting the [Chest Wall Center at the Cincinnati Children\\u2019s Hospital](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/c/chest-wall). After some breathing tests and an MRI, they determined I needed surgery. They found that my chest dent was not symmetrical and was mainly on the side close to my heart, causing some pressure on my heart, lungs, and liver. \\n\\nYesterday afternoon I went through the surgery and now I\\u2019m recovering. My chest is very tight at the moment and it is hard to take deep breaths. Once my body gets used to the bars I will be very much better off, but I need to get adjusted first. I\\u2019m on a lot of medicine at the moment (through an IV) and I have to undergo a lot of breathing exercises and some light physical therapy before I can head home in a few days. I\\u2019ll be out of school for 2-3 weeks as well because my range of motion will be severely limited and I will not be able to use my arms for anything. \\n\\nIf you have any questions about Pectus Excavatum, what the surgery is like, what I went through the day of surgery, what I\\u2019m doing now to recover, having and removing a catheter, or any other questions, I\\u2019d be glad to answer!!

Finland has compulsory military service, though women, Jehovah's Witnesses and people from \\xc5land are not required to serve. A civilian service option exists for those who refuse to serve in the military, but this service lasts more than twice as long as the shortest military service. So-called total objectors like me refuse both military and civilian service, which results in a sentence of 173 days.

In addition to my pacifist beliefs, I made my decision to protest against the human rights violations of Finnish conscription: international protectors of human rights such as Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Committee have for a long time demanded that Finland shorten the length of civilian service to match that of military service and that the possibility to be completely exempted from service based on conscience be given to everybody, not just a single religious group - Amnesty even considers Finnish total objectors prisoners of conscience.

I have described the Murdoch media not as a legitimate news organisation but indeed a political party seeking to advance its own commercial and ideological interests. I\\u2019ve also described Murdoch as a cancer on democracy, not just in this country, but in the United Kingdom and the United States.\\n\\nMy experience of the Murdoch media is canvassed extensively in the book I\\u2019ve recently published entitled Kevin Rudd The PM Years. It deals with the Murdoch medias campaign to destroy the National Broadband Network of fibre optic to the premises in order to advance Murdoch\\u2019s commercial interests in protecting the Foxtel cable based entertainment network in Australia. My book also details the vicious nature of Murdoch\\u2019s campaign against my government in the 2013 election. Also you may have seen the [attached opinion piece](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/citizen-murdoch-s-critical-grip-on-democracy-20190104-p50pkw.html) I wrote in last Saturdays Fairfax media on what Murdoch may seek to do next in seeking to ingratiate himself with the Labor party prior to the next election.\\n\\nIf you wish to discuss these and any other related matters then Reddit, Ask Me Anything!\\n\\nI\\u2019ll be answering questions this afternoon from 4:30pm to 6pm AEST. That\\u2019s 5:30pm to 7pm AEDT. Other times as applicable depending on where in this fair country of ours you happen to live.\\n\\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/MrKRudd/status/1082508187897454592)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[You can purchase my latest autobiography "Kevin Rudd - The PM Years" here](https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781760556686/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*EDIT: G\'day folks, I\'m now online as promised! So let\'s get into it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*EDIT 2: Hi folks, I\'ve been going for two hours now. Th\\xe9r\\xe8se expects me home for dinner. I\'ll try and get back to the hundreds of questions that have been posted in this session in the days ahead. In the mean time, thank you for your engagement. And on the core question of the Murdoch media, if you\'re so inclined, please get a hold of my most recent book to get an idea of what it was like dealing with Murdoch while in office - and what should now be done about it. Kind Regards K Rudd.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*EDIT 3: Well folks thanks for the great stack of questions which has come in through this AMA. The theme of the AMA was Murdoch\\u2019s impact on the Australian democracy. And that certainly has been a resounding, continuing theme in many of the questions asked of me. And in many of the answers I have given. Again if you want to explore these questions further, I\\u2019d encourage you to read on my website the articles I\\u2019ve written recently about what to do about Murdoch\\u2019s overwhelming political and media power in Australia. The answer to that, in my judgement, lies in a fully empowered royal commission with proper terms of reference with the object of guaranteeing maximum media diversity for Australia\\u2019s political future. I\\u2019d also encourage you to read volume two of my autobiography which has been released over the last couple of months. You can get it online. Or you can get it at your local book shop. So thanks very much for participating in this AMA. There has been quite a lot of response both directly and through the twitterverse. If you\\u2019re interested in particular on Murdoch\\u2019s interest in protecting his Foxtel entertainment network in Australia against internet based competitors (like the NBN) then again go to my website and have a look at the News Corporation\\u2019s compulsory filings on the NYSE from 2013 to 2017. These repeatedly point to the threat which internet based media businesses represented to the bottom line commercial interest of the Murdoch empire. The fact that Murdoch campaigned so viciously to defeat our government in 2013 and thereby to destroy the NBN as a competitor to Foxtel is underlined by the logic outlined in these compulsory filings.

I wanted a game to help me teach about the Westward Movement in the mid-1800s.  My partner math teachers knew some programming.  We had access to a mainframe computer that did all its communicating via printed text.  The result was the first version of what became the most popular educational computer game of the 1980s and 90s.  I brought the game to the Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation (MECC) when I started work there in 1974.  When personal computers like the Apple II hit the market a few years later, a MECC team converted the game to a version with graphics, animation, pioneer tunes, and some memorable quotes.  A classic was born. \\n\\nThousands of students who played Oregon Trail back then continue to enjoy fond memories of the game as evidenced by its appearance on TV and radio programs, T-shirts, online forums, and in everyday conversation.  I am here to answer your questions about how the game was invented, what the original version was like, what computing was like at the dawn of its use in schools, and my experiences with OT fans.  \\n\\nI am also interested to hear your stories of how you first encountered the game, what you learned from it, and how it affected you.  You might also share these stories with the Strong Museum of Play (Rochester, NY), home of the World Video Game Hall of Fame, which will soon select games to be enshrined in 2016: http://www.worldvideogamehalloffame.org/nominate\\n\\nForty-five years ago I was looking for a way to enliven the teaching of history.

I played Major League Baseball for 13 years with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers and won 2 World Series with the San Francisco Giants. I was a left-handed hitter and a right-handed 1st baseman who is probably best known for being the rally thong jackass. I was addicted to Adderal in my heyday from 2009-2011. In 2012, I got clean, then had a panic attack and my career ended.\\n\\nRetiring at age 37 was actually harder than making it to the Big Leagues. I dreamt of being a professional baseball player from a very young age. For 30+ years, my entire life revolved around baseball. When I retired, I felt like my identity and purpose was stripped away from me. I went from having adoring fans screaming my name, the VIP treatment everywhere I went, first-class flights and hotels and being treated like a hero to feeling like a zero. I missed the game, my friends, the camaraderie, life on the go. I had so much time on my hands, it made my sense of worthlessness even greater. I fell into a deep depression and had crippling anxiety. It got so bad I sat in my dark closet with a .357 Magnum aimed at my head, ready to end it all. \\n(You can read more about this on my blog: https://aubreyhuff.com/from-the-diamond-to-the-darkness/)\\n\\nLuckily I found my way and was able to let go of "Aubrey Huff the baseball player" and become "Aubrey Huff the proud father" raising my two sons to be remarkable young men.

Customers would be a small fee to enter, and that fee also counted towards their time to use in whichever booth they wanted to use. These booths were not always used to watch videos. On the daily, it would sound like someone was watching a video with the volume all the way up, *except a video wasn't playing*.

Because of the high-demand for his arrangements, the catchphrase \\u201cGet Shep\\u201d became\\ncommon among New York musicians. He toured with various Broadway shows while based in\\nNew York. One of these shows led to San Francisco, where he eventually settled and was the\\nhouse drummer at Finocchio\\u2019s for 23 years.

We have seen lab-grown meat and fat but very few dairy products. This is because dairy and especially cheese is one of those foods that is actually very very complicated and very unique in its structure and components. This makes it very difficult to mimic with purely plant-based ingredients which is why vegan hard cheeses are not great.\\n\\nSo we are taking the essential dairy proteins that give all the traits of dairy cheese that we love (texture, flavour, behaviour etc) and using microbes instead of a cow to produce them. We are then adding plant-based fats and sugars and making amazing tasting cheese without any animals :)\\n\\nProof: [https://twitter.com/newculturefoods/status/1114960067399376896](https://twitter.com/newculturefoods/status/1114960067399376896)\\n\\nEDIT: **you can be on our wait list to taste** [here](https://www.newculture.co.nz)!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thanks everyone for a fantastic AMA!';;;;1554690780.0b'I am Amber Nash, voice of Pam Poovey on Archer.

My story.';;;;14650;;;;cm06ze;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cm06ze/iama_female_born_with_failing_kidneys_a_solid/;;;;488;;;;b'Hi all. My name is Amanda and here is my story. I was born in 1990 and all seemed well until I fell very sick. Here is my story. In 1992 I ended up needing a kidney transplant from my mother due to interstitial nephritis. My Kidneys were not functioning properly and my mom got tested for compatibility. She ended up being a 5/6 which was good news! Parents are typically about a 3/6. The local hospital we had been staying at couldn\\u2019t handle the transplant in 1992 and sent us to Children\\u2019s Mercy West in Kansas City. I was their first transplant on a baby. The human body really is quite fascinating! As an adult, my mother\\u2019s kidney was adult sized and I was a small, petite and sickly two year old. After being transplanted into my body her kidney shrank back down and then regrew again through all of it\\u2019s stages with me. We were told it would work for approximately three years. Medicines were pretty harsh and Prograf and Cellcept weren\\u2019t around. It ended up working for 16 years because I am half made of kryptonite and plain awesome. Jokes! Note: they attempted to actually do this surgery three times. One time they opened her up, I sneezed and they called it off. Third time was the charm. Anyways, it worked 16 years.\\n\\nThat put me summertime, right before my senior year it failed. My dad and mom decided my dad would be my donor so my two elder siblings didn\\u2019t have to be tested nor worry about donating a kidney. That man and idol half killed himself to donate his kidney to me. They put him through a million tests. One was blood sugars. He knew he was diabetic but also knew I had to have a kidney. At the hospital they gave him a sugary drink and then he had to drink it there and come back in an hour to test his levels. This was for his safety to donate which wasn\\u2019t his priority. After drinking the drink he left the hospital and stuck his fingers down his throat and forced himself to purge the \\u201cdrink\\u201d.. literally popped a blood vessel in his eye. It was snowing heavily out so he walked six miles and started shoveling random driveways around the hospital for an hour to make sure he would pass. He did. Also lost about thirty pounds that the doctors said he would need to lose to donate. He wasn\\u2019t obese or anything but slightly heavier than the \\u201caverage\\u201d on their charts. They had checked if we were a match and we were a 3/6.. typical parental match with zero antibodies. They scheduled a date for the transplant and we drove down the night before to check in and stay the night. 6AM came early and I hadn\\u2019t eaten in forever but hey, I was gaining a healthy kidney. The nurse came in and said that she had to draw both our blood samples one last time before surgery. We had done it already like ten times over the last six months so wasn\\u2019t a big deal. The nurse said it was just to double check that I have no antibodies against him. I asked what were the chances that I would develop them overnight.. she said in the 25 years she had been there she had never seen it. \\n\\nWell, you guessed it. I had developed antibodies against my dad overnight since they had taken our blood the night before and he could no longer donate. It meant I would reject his kidney and it simply was no longer an option. Not often had I seen my dad cry but that was one of them. I did too. My high school friends had decorated the house for me to come home too so my mom quickly sent them a text and they ran over and undecorated the house. This meant my siblings would have to be tested. I will never forget the night before my college freshman brother\\u2019s lab draw. We spent most of the evening pacing the kitchen and living room floor. He asked me probably 100 plus questions about what it would be like. Genuinely terrified of something I did once a month my whole life and weekly during certain spurts. Take this in your pocket to remind yourself that just because someone\\u2019s fear may be silly or insignificant to you does not make their problem any less real or scary to them. Always show comfort and understanding the way you want it when you feel scared. Life hurdles simply are not a competition. My sister tested from Florida where she lived with her husband, she was five years older than myself. I went with my brother and he survived his testing bravely. The results showed I had antibodies against my brother but not my sister. They were both a 6/6 in match but my brother\\u2019s would be rejected. That meant my sister was the lucky winner. She graciously donated her kidney to me and I still have it to this day at 29 years old. It is quite the trooper. \\n\\nNow. Why you are really here. It started in the 8th grade. I had started my period but I did not know it. Over the course of six months I was in excruciating pain, constantly throwing up and my general health was spiraling downward. Finally after six months they saw my uterus was absolutely huge and swollen with six months of period blood. They life watched me due to the poisoning and toxic shock I was ill with. At Children\\u2019s Mercy I met the witch of a woman female gyno doctor. She believed that I had a thick hymen. They put me under anesthesia and when I woke my whole family was crying. I did not have a thick hymen, I had vaginal agenesis. We did not know this because naturally I wasn\\u2019t sexually active at that age and the outer appearance of my vagina looked completely normal. There were two surgeons in the US that either could or would be able to do my surgery.. maybe because my previous health issues. I am not sure. We traveled to the one and she turned me down. She had done the surgery once before on an 18 year old female who then committed suicide because the physical therapy required was too much. She would not do it on an eight grader, I wouldn\\u2019t be mature enough to handle it. Despite having to grow up much earlier in life from my other health issues. We went and saw doctor two.\\n\\nHe was one of the sweetest and most respectful doctors I had ever met. He agreed to do the surgery and advised that I not tell anyone what I was going through. He said in eighth grade your best friend today may not be tomorrow and that kids could make my life complete hell over something like this. I listened. I didn\\u2019t tell a soul. My vagina was almost entirely solid. He ordered dilators that I would have to use to stretch the skin up and open inside the vaginal canal. He asked if I was ready and said no one would be able to do it for me or make me do it. He said that if I ever wanted to eventually have my own children I would have to do this. I absolutely have always dreamed of being a mother and so I did it. Twenty minutes, twice daily for five years. They were so incredibly painful that there aren\\u2019t really any words. It was like putting a plug into an outlet with no holes because the dilators had to be bigger than what fit as to stretch the canal. Interesting fact. I had to buy an exercise bicycle because the angle of the seat would help me closely create the natural angle of a woman\\u2019s vagina. All a lot to think about secretly as an 8th grader. I did my \\u201csticks\\u201d, I preferred to call them sticks, for two years until I was a sophomore. At that point I had stretched the vagina canal skin up and open enough that they could do the surgery. They opened it and lay the skin at the top of the vagina like a natural vaginal canal. \\n\\nI sat up in bed after surgery and blood gushed out of me. It was insane. It sounded like when you turn your bathtub faucet on to fill the tub. So much blood. Black and smelling of death. The six months of period blood from two years prior could finally exit. I was so stoked to have my period like all my friends. I worked damn hard to be able to use those tampons. My mom and I went out and bought practically every brand of tampon and pad there was.. plum giddy. I had to continue to do the dilators for three years further so it wouldn\\u2019t close back down. Still twenty minutes, twice daily. The longest 40 minutes a day of those five years. I remember my junior year and there was this handsome fella I had my eye on. We started dating and I could tell hands were getting adventurous. I am not sure what normally goes through one\\u2019s mind then. I was thinking. Oh my goodness!!! I hope it works, I hope it works, I hope it works. Will it feel different? Will he notice? Will it hurt? Well I was his first finger to vagina experience so what the hell I was worried about.. I don\\u2019t really know. He wouldn\\u2019t have known if I was different. It did indeed work. Not on the orgasmic scale but it was a tunnel and fingers could enter and I was so fucking proud. Can you imagine if I had listened to the first surgeon and waited until 18 or older? That make out session would have turned incredibly awkward on a whole other level.\\n\\nFast forward to 2010.. aged 20.\\n\\nI am dating guy that was mentioned above after we separated when he went off to college and I had a year of high school left. I just moved to be in the same town as him and signed to start cosmetology school in four weeks. We took an eight day vacation to Disney and universal. I was hurting in my abdomen and throwing up randomly. Maybe like twice a day. Not constantly but something felt off. At the end of each day I would throw up and my feet were SO incredibly swollen that clear liquid was leaking out my toe nail beds. I knew I had chronic pain from adhesions from many surgeries and the many meds I took made me nauseous many times than not. Plus I was so focused on making sure my main squeeze was having the vacation of his life. I was determined not to let me be what ruined it for us. We get home and I go to my routine kidney appointment. He pushes on my abdomen and tells me I am not going home. When I would lay flat my stomach was uneven. The right side was raised higher than the left. After surgery they ended up removing a nine pound tumor that had engulfed my ovary. I had no clue I was basically full term pregnant. I will admit Reddit. This one got me. Knocked me down into a dark place. They had removed my left ovary a few years prior due to being damaged from the six months of period blood that had been sitting in my uterus and Fallopian tubes. This meant that I had done those horrible sticks for five years, hand built my own vagina, all so I could have my own kids one day. After a routine appt and a four hour surgery it was just gone. Ended up being ovarian cancer and am all clear and fine today. \\n\\nCurrent life: I have been with said man above for 10 years, married since 2012. We are foster parents to an amazing girl we got at three weeks old. We were wrote and asked to adopt this little girl by an entire extended family. From May 2018 until March 2019 we thought we were adopting this little girl. A bio relative has changed their mind after foster daughter living with us 18 months. Now we find ourselves in and out of court battling for her. Won\\u2019t give any details of the case or share pictures of kiddo. Only time will tell what path we go forward on. One thing is for certain. My husband is a lucky man, after all, he has a one of a kind, hand made vagina. \\U0001f609\\U0001f937\\U0001f3fc\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f\\U0001f61c\\n\\nAbdominal Scars and tumor picture: RIP my bellybutton.

Not sure how to explain disappearing everyday twenty minutes, twice a day to a roommate. Just seemed easier to tell the truth and she was a person I trusted dearly. Been a best friend since the third grade. Started with telling her.\\n\\nEdit 2) During the two years before they opened the canal, what happened with the blood and my period? Duh. Great question. The doctors believed that if I did depo provera, a birth control shot, every month that I would no longer have a period. The shot was normally given every three months. I went every month because it was critical that I wasn\\u2019t ovulating. The doctors also believed that while stopping the blood from continuing and with the shot would allow the blood to re-absorb back into my body basically. This didn\\u2019t work. That was discovered after the sophomore surgery when I sat up and the blood that had been there two years came out. My health suffered greatly and my coloring was sickly during those two years. I have no idea how I lived with it in my uterus chillin that long.\\n\\nMy Proof and my imgur! This link below \\nAbdominal Scars and tumor picture: RIP my bellybutton.

I was one of those kids.\\n\\nThe juvenile judge worked closely with schools and police to have a zero tolerance system for juveniles.\\n\\nThe County run detention center was closed down due to the work of these judges and this property owner. A private detention center was built and the judges were offered kickbacks for sending kids there since the privately run detention center was paid for having the kids. (Through CYS or some form of the government, I\'m not sure)\\n\\nMy first offense was when I was 14. My mom and I had gotten into an argument and I wanted to "run away". She stood in front of the door and I pushed her out of the way and left. Took a walk in the woods and came back home to find the police. She called them because I left. She just wanted help finding me, but they arrested me. Simple assault for pushing her.\\nI was put away for 6 months. My mom called everyone she could and somehow managed to get me out. \\n\\nMy second and final juvenile offense was when I was 15. I was in school playing with some ketchup packets or something equally as childish. One of the cafeteria aids came over and began yelling at me. I was a cocky little teenager and I made up some story about my dad being someone important and told her she would lose her job. I ran my finger across my throat when I told her this.\\nThe rest of the day went by and I was called down to the office just before dismissal. My mom was there and a police officer came. They all went into the office and I assumed the school was trying to scare me...\\nI was arrested and sent to the detention center. The judge told me I was charged with terroristic threats for threatening to kill the cafeteria aid. I was sent away for a little over two years.\\n\\nThere were no defense attorneys into he courtrooms. Only the judge and the children. We all knew he was very strict since he had visited our schools many times and talked to us about crimes and how he would have zero tolerance. \\nI had no idea at the time that anything was wrong with the system. Every kid just thought it was normal. \\nAbout a year after I was released the situation was exposed and investigated. The judges were arrested and the children were part of a class action lawsuit.\\n\\nI spent a year and half of my high school years getting a very dulled down education consisting of multiplication tables and learning middle school level history. I was between 50 and 200 miles away from my family and because of this I went months without visits. I got a phone call once every few days if I was lucky. I was housed with kids who had gun charges, drug charges, and attempted murder charges. I was borderline abused by staff members.\\nThe class action settlement was about $20,000, which I don\'t know if that made up for everything.\\n\\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/Y35F4\\n\\nEDIT: documentary is here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpNynnYwC0\\n\\nAsk me anything.\\n\\nEdit: I chose to not use the word "victim" because I do not see myself as a victim. I did what I did. I may not have deserved what I got, but I initiated what happened.\\nI don\'t want pity, or anything of the sort. Just getting the rest of this situation off my chest and answering questions anyone may have about what happened.\\n\\nI took some steps to hide my identity, but with the story taking place in scuba small area and with personal details being put out, it\'s very easy to figure out. Who I am doesn\'t have to do with the story, but I don\'t care if anyone knows who I am or not.\\n\\nThe documentary has apparently been removed from Netflix but is still on YouTube.

There's a lot of confusion out there - yes, health insurance can be confusing - when it comes to Open Enrollment and signing up for coverage. And that confusion is even worse this year. That's why we wanted to do an AMA and it's why we started [Get America Covered](https://www.getamericacovered.org/). To cut through the confusion and make sure people have the information they need to sign up for coverage or to renew their current health insurance. \\n\\nThere's only about two weeks left to sign up for coverage at [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) - the final deadline is December 15. The majority of states use [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) but if you live in California, New York or one of the other 10 states (including DC) that operates their own exchange you'll have a bit more time.  \\n\\nIt can be hard to believe but health coverage really could be more affordable than you think. That's even more true this year than ever before. Because 8 out of 10 HealthCare.gov consumers qualify for financial help, most people can find plans for less than $75. In fact, [4.5 million uninsured can find health plans with zero premiums](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/analysis-more-than-half-of-uninsured-people-eligible-for-marketplace-insurance-could-pay-less-for-health-plan-than-individual-mandate-penalty/) each month. Those plans aren't right for everybody but if you're debating whether you can afford health coverage this year, you should at least check out your options - you may be surprised.\\n\\nIt's important to note though that if you don't qualify for financial help - premiums have gone up. Depending on where you live, premiums have gone up a lot. We can go into the details as to why but we need to fix it and make sure that politicians can't continue to play politics with your health care. \\n\\nSo, let\\u2019s talk about signing up for health coverage.

They sent me to Doha for the past 2.5 years. While there, I worked on some amazing projects and was in the most elite of practice groups. I had my second son. I witnessed a society that had the most extreme rich:poor divide you could imagine. I met people who considered other people to be of less human worth. I helped a poor mother get deported after she spent 3 years in jail for having a baby out of wedlock, arrested at the hospital and put in jail with her baby. I became disgusted by luxury lifestyle and lawyers who would give anything and everything to make millions. I encountered blatant gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and a very clear glass ceiling. Having a baby apparently makes you worth less as a lawyer. While overseas, I became inspired to start a company making boy dolls after I couldn't find any cool ones for my own sons. So I hired my sister to start a company that I would direct. Complete divergence from my line of work, I know, but I was convinced this would be a great niche business. As a lawyer, I was working sometimes 300 hours in a month and missing my kids all the time. I felt guilty for spending any time not firm related. I never had a vacation where I did not work. I missed my dear grandmother's funeral in December. In March I made the final decision that this could not last. There must be a better way. So I resigned. And now I am sitting in my mother's living room, having moved the whole family in temporarily - I have not lived with my mother since I was 17. I have moved out of Qatar. I have given up my very nice salary. I have no real plans except I am joining my sister to build my company. And I'm feeling a bit surreal and possibly insane for having given it up. Ask me anything!\\n\\n**I'm answering questions as fast as I can!  Wow!  But my 18 month old just work up jet lagged too and is trying to eat my computer.....slowing me down a bit!**\\n\\n**This is crazy - I can't type as fast as the questions come in, but I'll answer them.  This is fascinating.  AM I SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO EVERYONE??!**\\n\\n**10:25 AM EST:  Taking a short break.  Kids are now awake and want to actually spend time with them :)**\\n\\n**11:15 AM EST:  Back online.  Will answer as many questions as I can.  Kids are with husband and grandma playing!**\\n\\n***PS: I was thinking about this during my break:  A lot of people have asked why I am doing this now.  I have wanted to say some public things about my experience for quite some time but really did not dare to do so until I was outside of Qatar, and I also wanted to wait until the law firm chapter of my life was officially closed.  I have always been conservative in expressing my opinion about my experience in Qatar while living there because of the known incidents of arrests for saying things in public that are contrary to the social welfare and moral good.  This Reddit avenue appealed to me because now I feel free to actually say what I think about things and have an open discussion.  It is so refreshing - thank you everyone for the comments and questions.  Forums like this are such a testament to the value of freedom of expression.***\\n\\n***Because several people have asked, here's a link to the Kickstarter campaign for my toy company.

Although none of us are journalists ourselves, we really relish these conversations, particularly challenging ones, about the state of the world's media and of freedom of expression, and it's really great to see so much engagement on critically important issues. We may not agree on everything, but hopefully we agree that freedom of expression needs to be safeguarded against all threats.\\n\\nThings appear to be winding down a bit, so we're going to call time at 15:00 EST. Thanks again!\\n\\n*Edited 8:30 pm*: Circled back through and saw that a couple of questions about Saudi Arabia and Iran have risen to the top, so I thought I'd address them. Saudi Arabia has an absolutely atrocious human rights record, including but not limited to free speech issues. One of the world's worst governments, and one which several of my colleagues on this AMA have been highly critical of in the past:\\nhttps://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38207/en/saudi-arabia:-poet-ashraf-fayadh-given-death-sentence-for-apostasy \\nhttp://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/browse/5/backpid/59/category/gender-equality/article/ifj-condemns-brutal-and-inhumane-saudi-action-against-woman-journalist/\\n\\nMy own organization hasn't been very active on Saudi Arabia not because we have any affinity for that horrendous government, but rather because, as a small organization, we tend to focus our resources on countries where we see some potential of impacting positive change, which just isn't the case in Saudi. It's the same reason we haven't been that active on China or North Korea. We look for places we can make a difference, as opposed to those whose governments are completely indifferent to human rights criticism.\\n\\nRegarding Iran - another atrocious government, and again one which my colleagues have been sharply critical of: https://www.article19.org/en/azad/, http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/backpid/1/article/iran-three-journalists-arrested-in-one-week/. Again, it's not an area we've been particularly active, because, as /u/hotsoccerchic points out, outside criticisms seem to only fuel the hardliners. In terms of what to do in a case like that - solidarity among the rest of the world is important, as well as consideration of a country's human rights record in establishing economic relations. Without necessarily coming out in support or opposition to the recent Iranian nuclear deal, I do think that the country's human rights record has, to a certain degree, fallen by the wayside with the focus on their nuclear programme. Hopefully, with the proliferation of the Internet and the increasing democratisation of tools of mass communication, Iran's youth will be empowered to finish the work of the Green Revolution in 2009 though, like Turkey and the Philippines, when a country is dead-set against respecting human rights, and has solid support of the army and security services, it's incredibly challenging to impact change.";;;;1493841693.0b'IamA entrepreneur who sold more than $22M worth of online businesses and built a 100% remote company while traveling the world - all from my laptop.

We\\u2019re constantly adding new games every month, and they all have to meet our quality standards to make sure you get the best gaming experience. Jump delivers most games in under 60-seconds via our HyperJump technology, which is NOT streaming, but rather delivers games in chunks to your computer so they run as if they were installed (no latency or quality issues), but without taking up permanent hard drive space.\\n\\nPROOF 1: https://i.imgur.com/wLSTILc.jpg\\nPROOF 2: https://playonjump.com/about \\n\\n\\n**FINAL EDIT (probably):** This has been a heck of a day.

I attended Marysville Pilchuck High School in Marysville, Washington from 2013-2015. I was born and raised in Washington state, before eventually moving to Charleston, South Carolina at the end of my Sophomore year. \\n\\nThe shooting happened during my Sophomore year. School was somewhat enjoyable at best for me, I never really liked school or even the social aspect of it. I constantly begged my parents to let me do online school, more so after the shooting though. \\n\\nDespite all that, the kids I went to school with were people I grew up with, people that I had once made a connection with in the past. We were a pretty small community. I also had a solid group of friends at the time that I still talk to today. My classes weren\'t bad either, although geometry was a huge struggle. I liked my teachers, we were all pretty close. My school was laid back, not too tight on the rules and everyone generally got along pretty well.\\n\\nThe morning of the shooting was like any other. Wake up 10 minutes before school, my brother yelling up the stairwell telling me to get my ass in the car or he\'d leave me. We lived about a mile from the school, so the ride was fairly short. We were probably listening to some shitty rap song as we zig-zagged across speed bumps and screeched into the parking lot a couple of minutes before class. I rushed to first period, English 2 Honors, and plopped down in my seat, late as always. \\n\\nI don\'t remember that morning being much different from any other, class was the same as always. I trudged onto second period, some sort of computer class. That class wasn\'t interesting so I never paid much attention. Then third period, health class with one of my favorite teachers. Again, a normal day.\\n\\nOur classes were shortened, since it was a half day. Our school had half days every Friday due to budget cuts. We weren\'t exactly the wealthiest community. After third period I had first lunch, I walked into the "small" lunchroom around 10:00 A.M and sat down, talking to my boyfriend at the time on the phone. My friends didn\'t have first lunch that day, so I sat alone, blabbering on the phone. \\n\\nIf I remember correctly around 10:20 A.M, the fire alarm went off. Everyone evacuated the building as expected. I remember laughing with one of my brothers friends, joking about how it was probably one of the seniors pulling a prank. Then I heard a bang. It sounded pretty far off, so I didn\'t think about it. Then I heard more... that was when fear finally settled in.\\n\\nIt all happened within a matter of minutes. At 10:24 A.M the first shot happened. I remember running like my life depended on it. I was aiming for the parking lot. A lot of my brothers friends were heading to their cars to leave, I so badly wanted to go with them. I wanted to go to safety. I wanted to go home.\\n\\nI never made it to the parking lot. My limbs were heavy with the thought that someone I know might be dead. My heart hurt from beating so hard. I think I cried. I don\'t know. I just know that I was afraid. I still feel that fear today.\\n\\nOne of the Spanish teachers who shared a room with my first period teacher grabbed me so hard it knocked the wind out of me. I remember begging him to let me go, to let me go to my brothers friends. I had known them my whole life practically, they were my brothers too. I wanted my brothers to take me away from the horrific tragedy that had just occurred seconds ago. \\n\\nHe refused, and shoved me into the room and locked the door behind us. Standing there, in that room, the stench of fear was so tangible I still see it every fucking day. It was like my life was in slow motion. I scanned the room, kids were huddled in corners, shoved under desks. The air was so thick I thought I was choking. It felt like that room was 100 degrees. There was probably 50 or so students in a room meant for 25. \\n\\nI found a spot under a large table right underneath the  only window in that room. I looked to my left and there was a group of freshman girls huddled by the teachers desk. I remember one girl hysterically crying, swearing up and down that her best friend was dead. I think that\'s when It finally sunk in.\\n\\nI smushed myself under that table between two guys I didn\'t know. I was still on my phone with my at-the-time boyfriend, and he swore up and down that he wouldn\'t hang up, that he would sit through this with me. Despite the disaster that relationship was, I will always remember him talking me through that entire experience and keeping me somewhat sane for the time being. I will forever appreciate that.\\n\\nThe texts finally started coming in from all of my family members. "Are you okay?" "Are you hurt?" I didn\'t really know how to respond, but I did. I was huddled under that desk for over two hours, watching the newscasts quietly with hushed voices thick with tears. The anxiety, the fear, that\'s all I could feel. \\n\\nFinally, the police knocked on the door and demanded that we open up. They came in, guns raised and flipped on the lights. I remember standing up and covering my eyes only to be told to hold my hands high in the air. I trembled as a police man pointed his gun near me, my heart couldn\'t beat any faster in that moment. We were told to grab our cell phones only and to exit the room in a orderly, single filed line. We ran out of the room, flanked by policeman.\\n\\nThat first breath of fresh air wasn\'t refreshing. It was heavy, filled with sorrow and agony. We ran, and ran until we were escorted on a school bus and sent off to a church not far from the school. The ride there was a blur, and being there was one too. We had to sign our name in check in, and go out front to wait for our parents.\\n\\nI\'m not religious, but I do remember walking through that church and just hoping that someone would rid my body of the crippling anxiety I felt. It\'s still there, it never went away. \\n\\nI hugged some of my teachers and cried with them, holding hands with people I hadn\'t spoken to in years and telling them that it\'ll all be okay. Eventually I was outside waiting for my mom behind a line of police tape. I saw her and she pulled me through the tape and hugged me so hard.  I heard her sobs in my ear as she shook and petted my head. Her heart was absolutely broken, mine was too.  I didn\'t know how to feel, I didn\'t cry with her, I wanted to. I just couldn\'t feel anymore. I lost a part of myself that day that I\'ll never get back.\\n\\nWe then retrieved my brother and my dad came to pick us all up, and we went home. At home I sat on the couch and watched the on-going news reports with my family. Nobody said a word. Later on that night I found out one of my childhood friend, Zoe, had died in the shooting. I didn\'t cry then either. I went up to my room and didn\'t come back out the rest of the night.\\n\\nWe had the next week off of school after the shooting. Our community really came together after everything. Nothing really helped my healing process though, it\'s still an on-going thing.\\n\\nI now suffer from PTSD (diagnosed by a psycho-therapist). This shooting has affected my life in so many ways. Any loud noise sends my pulse skyrocketing. A book slamming on a desk, loud beeping sounds, alarms, fire trucks, police sirens, banging noises, all of this immediately sends me back to that initial moment when the fear struck me. I can\'t trust people. \\n\\nThe unpredictability of that day has forever traumatized me. I so badly want people in my life to understand that it\'s not their fault that I have an extremely hard time trusting. It\\u2019s not my fault.  I am constantly hyper aware of my surroundings, I notice every little detail. My body is always tense, I don\'t know if I\'ll ever truly relax again. Anxiety is a daily thing, I\'m not sure if it\'ll go away anytime soon. \\n\\nI lost some of myself that day, and it was replaced with fear and anxiety and intense trust issues. As unfortunate as that is, it\'s who I am. I cannot tell you how many nights I have spent on the bathroom floor, crying, wheezing, hurting and just wishing that things were different. But they aren\'t, they never will be. The only thing I can do now is move forward. \\n\\nI am a survivor of a school shooting. \\n\\nI will always be afraid.\\n\\n\\nProof:\\n\\nHere is a picture of my school ID from that year \\n[ID](http://imgur.com/a/iaVYO)\\n\\nHere is a picture take by a news person of my mom hugging me after she found me\\n[mom and me ](http://imgur.com/a/d5TR8)\\n\\nAnd here is a picture of me now holding my school ID\\n[me](http://imgur.com/a/IzUgQ)\\n\\nAlso here is the link to the Wikipedia article about the shooting.

Additionally, 16 governments and several organizations have just pledged $1.2B to eradicate polio.  Rotary has already contributed over 1.6 billion U.S. dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours of volunteer time to the eradication of polio. When we succeed in eradicating polio, it would become only the second disease to be eradicated by vaccines, the other being smallpox.\\n\\n \\nPersonally, I have known Dr. Salk, creator of the inactivated polio vaccine, and Dr. Sabin, creator of the oral polio vaccine through my work at the National Institutes of Health. In 1979 the last case of endemic polio was reported in the U.S. I, along with Rotary International president, Clem Renouf, brought to Rotary the idea to make it our chief goal to eradicate polio worldwide.  For the last 11 years, I have been carrying on the visions of Drs. Salk and Sabin as the vice-chairman of Rotary International\\u2019s PolioPlus program, which helps oversee Rotary\\u2019s polio vaccination efforts worldwide. \\n\\n \\nContext:\\n\\n \\nIn 1916, polio was an epidemic in the United States with over 27,000 cases and 6,000 deaths. Following the availability of Dr. Salk\\u2019s inactivated vaccine in 1955 and Dr. Sabin\\u2019s oral polio vaccine in 1962, polio began to decline in developed countries where they were used. That decline began to accelerate as groups such as Rotary International began to champion the issue in the early 1980s.\\n\\n \\nToday, polio is nearly eradicated globally, as we\\u2019ve seen a 99.9% reduction \\u2013 from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to just 6 reported cases so far in 2017. Polio is virtually eradicated, but there is still so much more to do. If we don\\u2019t continue to vaccinate, we could see 200,000 new cases every year \\u2013 giving polio an unprecedented resurgence.\\n\\n\\nProof: https://i.redd.it/8b4euv7l1n4z.jpg\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks very much for all of your questions today.

I\'m not trying to say that being sexualized is a good thing but there\'s something about seeing your body type represented in porn that makes you feel a little bit accepted. Well, I decided that taking "nudes" of myself might be a way to help make myself feel better. I started taking these kinds of pictures as recently as two weeks after the surgery! While it helped me to take these pictures, I realized that I couldn\'t change anything about society by keeping them to myself so I thought about it long and hard and discussed it with my boyfriend/the love of my life and finally decided to post it on here.\\nI\'ve posted this picture here to inspire any woman to feel sexy.

So, now, I am managing our company\'s largest store, and am swamped with managerial duties, training employees, and dealing with annoying vendors. But, I\'m taking some time out for all of you guys.\\n\\nThere are lots of new, exciting things that have recently come out/are coming soon! \\n\\nFor those who ***NEED*** the most power, I\'ve got just the Crack you need! Since we last talked, there are new bagless and cordless vacuums on the market, and some other exciting things.\\n\\nSo, on to business...here\'s the copypasta.\\n\\n[First AMA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pe2bd/iama_vacuum_repair_technician_and_i_cant_believe/)\\n\\n[Second AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24rx7e/hi_reddit_im_here_to_make_your_day_suck_better/)\\n\\n[Last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ldfs3/iama_vacuum_repair_technician_and_this_is_the_1/)\\n\\n[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/donttouchmycoffee/)\\nHere\'s some basics to get you started:\\n\\n\\n* Dollar for dollar, a bagged vacuum, when compared to a bagless, will almost always:\\n\\n1) Perform better (Actual quality of cleaning).\\n\\n2) Be in service for much longer.\\n\\n3) Cost less to repair and maintain (Often including consumables).\\n\\n4) Filter your air better.\\n\\nVirtually every vacuum professional in the business chooses a bagged vacuum for their homes, because we know what quality is.\\nThings you should do to maintain your vac, regularly:\\n\\n1) Clear your brush roller/agitator of hair and fibers. Clear the bearing caps as well, if possible. (monthly)\\n\\n2) Change your belts before they break. This is important to maintain proper tension against the agitator. (~ yearly for "stretch" belts)\\n\\n3) Never use soap when washing any parts of your vacuum, including the outer bag, duct system, agitator, filters, etc. Soap attracts dirt, and is difficult to rinse away thoroughly.\\n\\n* Types of vacs:\\n\\n1) Generally, canister vacs are quieter and more versatile than uprights are. They offer better filtration, long lifespans, and ease of use. They handle bare floors best, and work with rugs and carpets, as well.\\n\\n2) Upright vacuums are used mostly for homes that are entirely carpeted. Many have very powerful motors, great accessories, and are available in a couple of different motor styles. Nothing cleans shag carpeting like the right upright.\\n\\n3) Bagless vacs are available in a few different styles. They rely on filters and a variety of aerodynamic methods to separate the dirt from the air. In general, these machines do not clean or filter as well as bagged vacuums. They suffer from a loss of suction, and tend to clog repeatedly, if the filters are not cleaned or replaced often.\\n\\n4) Bagged vacuums use a disposable bag to collect debris, which acts as your primary filter, before the air reaches the motor, and is replaced when you fill it. Because this first filter is changed, regularly, bagged vacuums tend to provide stronger, more consistent suction.\\n\\nMy last, best piece of advice is to approach a vacuum, like any appliance; Budget for the best one you can get. Buy one with idea you will maintain it, and use it for many years. And, for the love of Dog, do not buy from late-night infomercials or door-to-door salesmen! Stay out of the big-box stores, and visit your local professional who actually knows what they\'re talking about.';;;;1512081968.0b'[Ama Request] with a former member of Kids Bop';;;;13269;;;;7zp4d5;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7zp4d5/ama_request_with_a_former_member_of_kids_bop/;;;;1001;;;;b"Questions for a former Kids Bop member. \\n\\n1.

AMA!';;;;13212;;;;83ylhi;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/83ylhi/i_left_the_amish_13_years_ago_i_self_published_my/;;;;1151;;;;b"I was not born Amish. I was held in captivity by mother and stepfather until I was almost 19 years old. My stepfather forced my family to dress and live like the Amish. My sister and I escaped our abusive home by agreeing to join the Amish. Three years after joining the Amish I became the maid for the bishop's family and for the next 6 months, I was sexually abused by the bishop. I went against Amish church customs and reported him to the police but he escaped into Canada. In 2017 ( 12 years later) the bishop was finally sentenced to 10 years in prison for molesting almost all of his 11 children. \\n\\n\\nThe bishop had brought his family back to the USA and in 2016 the three oldest daughters went to a neighbor lady for help. The neighbor called CPS and they called in law enforcement. The detective assigned to the case was reading my [memoir ](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)   at the time and when one of the children mentioned they had lived in Canada for awhile he figured out that the man he was investigating was the bishop from the book he was reading. I was put in contact with the children and their social worker. Eventually raising awareness did make a difference. The Social worker told me that my memoir helped her understand how to communicate with the children and gave her insight into Amish beliefs. The children told me that they were wavering on prosecuting their dad until they discovered my memoir. Sadly, our entire church had known what kind of man the bishop was but did not report him to the police. Going to the police is severely frowned upon among the Amish. \\n\\nI wrote my memoir  [Tears of the Silenced](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1520379874&sr=1-1) (self published)  to raise awareness about the need to report suspected child abuse and the difficulties I faced when reporting the Amish bishop. In the three years since I published *Tears of the Silenced* I have received emails from all over the world ( England, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Germany, Denmark and Holland). Most are from child abuse and sexual assault survivors and many grew up in very strict Christian churches. They are from both men and women and each story is heartbreaking. I try to answer each email and offer what comfort or help that I can. Most of them tell me I am the first person they have ever told their stories to. \\n\\nI hope to encourage all abuse survivors to speak out and tell their stories. It is very painful to do so but it can raise awareness and possibly save others from being abused by the abuser(s). There is much awareness needed about sexual abuse in very conservative churches. Many victims are too scared to come forward because they fear being ostracised from the church. Also, child abuse is an issue that never gets enough attention. Somehow we need to encourage the general public to report suspected cases of child abuse. After I left the Amish many people from the town where I lived as a child apologized for not helping my sister and me. They told me that they knew we were being abused and wanted to call CPS many times but our religious garb threw them off and they did not know what to do. \\n\\nI had a 2nd or 3rd-grade education when I left the Amish. Today, 13 years later, I am in the last year of nursing school and an author. (My [memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) is self published but has sold approx 100,000 ebooks, has 2089 reviews and has been on the *Amazon Kindle Store Top 100 list*  three times. ) I want to encourage all abuse victims to follow their dreams, do not let allow your abuser win. What they did to you was not your fault! I recently started a new subreddit r/BreakTheSilence for abuse survivors to tell their stories and support each other.\\n\\nProof https://twitter.com/ExAmish101/status/973288472357191680\\n\\n[ My  Amazon Author Page](https://www.amazon.com/Misty-Elaine-Griffin/e/B00YD19BSO/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0)  has pictures of me when I was 16 years old and still at home with my mother and stepfather. These pictures were taken so that social services would not come out and check up on us. My mother told them it was against our religion to have government officials in our house. They did not question her and took the pictures instead. Note how my stepfather is holding onto our arms in the third picture.\\n\\n\\n**Hello everyone, thank you so much for all of your comments.

I'm James Cordrey, the guy that brought you Drunk Christmas Cards! Now I'm doing something crazier: Running for State Representative in Missouri. Ask me Anything!";;;;12982;;;;82yyiw;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/82yyiw/hey_im_james_cordrey_the_guy_that_brought_you/;;;;1152;;;;b'Well hello there!\\n\\nI\'m [James Cordrey](https://www.facebook.com/ElectJamesCordrey/posts/435510173536060), and I\'m running in Missouri\'s 109th representative district.\\n\\nYou might remember me from some of my other Reddit posts - like [Drunk Christmas Cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/7e8v5h/offer_the_drunk_christmas_card_extravaganza/), or maybe [The time I found and played this cool Batman Arcade Game](https://imgur.com/a/kwKIY) or perhaps, even, [My D&D posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4v1xba/how_to_build_your_world_part_one/).\\n\\nOr maybe you\'ve never heard of me before, and you\'re just now getting to meet me. Let me tell you some things about me, and what I care about. Then we\'ll get to the heart of the matter: Your questions.\\n\\nI\'m 31 years old. For a few more days, anyway. I like to read, write, and program small things that are useless to pretty much anyone who is not me. I\'m a software developer for a medium sized company, I own my own small business, and I am currently going to school for a BS in Software Development. So, of course, right now was the perfect time to jump into politics, right?\\n\\nI grew up bouncing around from place to place, but a recurring location was my grandfather\'s farm. I learned the value of a hard day\'s work, and what it really means to be a steward of the land. That respect for our planet, and the people living here, is probably the biggest push for me in running for office. I believe that people deserve every opportunity to live decent lives, charted by their own desires, thoughts and ambitions. Nobody should have a life "forced" on them based on where they were born, or the economic status of their parents.\\n\\nThis campaign isn\'t against anything; not directly. I\'m not running "against" the Republicans, and I\'m certainly not running against a specific person. I\'m running for something. To help provide opportunities for all students to have access to a truly excellent education system. Farmers should find it easier to sell the product of their toil in marketplaces, without fear of large corporate farms undercutting them and driving them out of business. People are the heart of this campaign, and I want to run for *everyone* in the 109th district.\\n\\nSo. Where can you find out a little more about me? Well. My [Campaign Page](http://www.facebook.com/electjamescordrey) is a good place to start, and you can then jump over to my [Website](http://www.jamescordrey.com) to learn a bit more about me. I can also be found on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JamesCordrey) and [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/jamesccordrey) if those are more your style. Of course, you can skip all of that and just ask your questions here. I\'ll do my very absolute best to skip the normal political non-answers and give you as honest, and thorough of an answer as I can. If there\'s one thing we know about Redditors, it\'s that we can hold people to a higher standard, am I right?\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in donating to my campaign, (and you live in the United States) you can find the form for that [here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/elect-james-cordrey-1).\\n\\n... That was really long-winded. Sorry. Ask me your questions!\\n\\nEdit: WOOF! That was a lot of questions, and I see I have, at this point, 34 more comments ready to go! I\'ve gotta go for a bit, but you better believe I\'ll be back to answer those messages. (And if I missed one, reach out to me via PM on Facebook or here, and I\'ll get to it.)\\n\\nThanks guys, you\'ve been great, and I\'m glad I got some tough questions! You were wonderful. \\n\\nRemember to register to vote, wherever you are, and make your voices heard.\\n\\nEdit 2: Came back last night to answer more questions, then back again this morning to pick up the stragglers. You guys had a lot of really good questions, and they weren\'t easy, fluffy questions either! Thank you so much for your support, and thank you to the people I disagreed with - stay involved!

It's not a good idea for anyone to consider being a member. I hope from this post and this discussion that people realize that nobody is truly invulnerable to it. Posts like this (I know it's not the first) help to further the massive, but obviously incomplete, awareness about this cult. I can definitely appreciate the skeptics in the comments who have managed to interpret my comments as pro-Scientology, I merely meant to acknowledge the ways that the org can lure people in. To be entirely unambiguous: DON'T JOIN SCIENTOLOGY!!!! I CAN'T BE MORE DIRECT ABOUT IT. DON'T EVEN CHECK IT OUT. HELP YOUR FRIENDS TO AVOID IT OR LEAVE IT. IT IS A CULT. BAAAAAAAD. Please check out documentaries on Scientology at the bottom of the post.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had been a Scientologist for 5+ years and her mom for 15+. I knew about her involvement but we just avoided the conversation, which was easy because she wasn\\u2019t actively practicing and we were happy. When things were rocky in Fall 2018, she sought guidance from the Church and then suggested that the \\u201cTech\\u201d would help us to get along better. I knew a lot of the bad things people say about Scientology, but I figured looking at her book (Dianetics) couldn\\u2019t do harm... then I figured seeing the welcome center at the Church couldn\\u2019t do harm... then I figured participating in a 7hr $30 course on Integrity couldn\\u2019t do harm... then I figured purchasing a $2500 12.5hr auditing session couldn\\u2019t do harm... then another session for myself, then I fronted one for her, and prepurchased the \\u201cPurification Rundown\\u201d for both of us -- suddenly I had spent $12,000 at the Church of Scientology.\\n\\nWhile trying to make my final purchase for $5000 with a credit card, the bank denied it; when I called to authorize it they said that certain organizations had been flagged to protect consumers, because they had a disproportionately large correlation with folks who default on their credit card. This was a red flag that flew over my head, and the financial guys at the church worked diligently to find a paypal loophole.\\n\\nA major difference between my girlfriend and me was that she kept her involvement in Scientology a secret. When I began to gain momentum in Scientology and felt it was improving my life, I was eager to tell my friends; this ended up being the key to helping me get out. My friends say that my mind was so open it could fall out, but that meant it was also easy to put back in. I have never been religious in any capacity and I tend to be a hardcore skeptic and technical thinker, but there appears to be real and exciting value when you are starting off in Scientology. It makes you feel important and capable of growth. A yearning to have a meaningful life, an overcommitment to a sinking relationship, and a well-designed cult nearly became a concoction for losing my family, my money and my sense of self.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve spent the last few months attempting to get my money back and it has been a doozy. The organization is designed like a chinese fingertrap for its money and its members, and I\\u2019ve learned a few things in the process. I may have advice for recent defectors (believe me it\\u2019s common) who are trying to repair their life and finances. The silver bullet for me ended up being disputing the transactions with my credit card companies, on the basis of being denied the refund they offer within 90 days. I would have been squashed or led on if I tried to solicit my money legally from the Church, but by disputing the transaction and providing evidence to the credit card companies, I placed the ball in their court and they let the challenge period (60 days) expire. I have all $12k back now!\\n\\nTL;DR girlfriend got me into Scientology despite my scientific disposition, I advertised it to my friends who intervened, and I was able to get my money back via credit card disputes\\n\\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/ATOfaVS](https://imgur.com/a/ATOfaVS)  [https://imgur.com/a/TPn1fmh](https://imgur.com/a/TPn1fmh)  \\n\\n\\nDocumentaries, curated by [u/dmt\\\\_burrito](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmt_burrito): \\n\\n* [Going Clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7dh9o/going_clear_scientology_and_the_prison_of_belief/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [Scientology: The Shrinking World of LRH](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7dj4k/scientology_the_shrinking_world_of_l_ron_hubbard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [The Secrets of Scientology (BBC)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7dmlm/bbc_panorama_the_secrets_of_scientology_2010/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [LRH - Secret Lives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7doiu/l_ron_hubbard_secret_lives_1997_documentary_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [Scientology - How to Spot a Cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7drij/scientology_how_to_spot_a_cult_2009_former/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [Inside the Scientology Celebrity Centre](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7du0m/inside_the_scientology_celebrity_centre_2014_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [One Day, One Destiny - Tom Cruise in Scientology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7e06c/one_day_one_destiny_tom_cruise_in_scientology/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [Scientology: A Father's Story - Ron Miscavige Interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7e4iv/scientology_a_fathers_story_ron_miscavige/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n* [Scientology and Paul Haggis: 'It's A Cult'](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/b7e7jh/scientology_paul_haggis_its_a_cult_2013_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n\\nedit: EX-girlfriend\\n\\nedit: I am taking off for the day, but I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow to answer more questions!

For those of you that are unfamiliar what Hasidim are, the Hasidic community is a very religious and traditional community, with a lot of strict rules and customs. There\\u2019s a very big focus on staying isolated and not letting in any outside secular influences, which in result creates a very tight nit and family oriented community. \\nAlmost everything in our lifestyle is completely different from regular society. From the biggest thing in life, like family, marriage, education, language etc, to the most little ones like, which shirt you\\u2019re allowed to wear, or which number blade you\\u2019re allowed to cut your hair. \\nThere\\u2019s so much interesting experiences and observations that I can write about. It probably requires a whole book. But I\\u2019ll leave it up for your questions! \\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nPs. I\\u2019m not in the position to put my face in public so the IAmA mods have verified my authenticity confidentiality. \\n\\nEdit 1: I thought I might get some questions but I wasn\\u2019t expecting sooo much so fast. I really thank you for your interest and asking questions!\\nEnglish is not my first language and I\\u2019ve never formally learned to write English well. It takes me long to respond, but I\\u2019ll try to answer every question slowly. I\\u2019ll be back in a hour or two. \\n\\nEdit 2: I was out for a while and just checked back in, I\\u2019m speechless. I really do appreciate each and everyone that responds, I really want to answer every single comment. (I\\u2019m usually on the other end where I wait for the OP to respond) I feel like I want to grab a mic and scream shhhh, I\\u2019ll get to you all, just one at a time. But as of now I don\\u2019t see a mic button on the app. \\n\\nIt seems that if I answer the top question that already have hundreds of sub comments, my answer gets buried on the bottom. I think I\\u2019ll try for now to answer the newer ones and see how that works. Thank you guys!\\n\\nEdit 3: I\\u2019m still trying to answer your questions and I will try to continue in the next few days. \\n\\nThere has been a few people that had some interesting ideas and some even mentioned that they would want to meet. I don\\u2019t know if that can happen so fast but I would like stay in touch. I\\u2019m having a hard time finding a lot of people between thousands of messages. I figured I will create an email account and maybe it will be  easier to manage.

We eventually got out and from I was told by her and eye witnesses, she was struck by one of the downed power lines. I got her off the downed line immediately, then it struck and grounded me. 10,000 volts 7 amps for about 5 mins. It entered my left leg, exited my right hand, and face. I also suffered a few major and minor blowouts, one on my left chest above my heart, left shoulder, and down the left arm. I had full thickness burns (past third degree) on the majority of my face, I have a BKA (below knee amputation) on the left leg, and I lost two fingers on the right hand (ring and pinkie). I was in the hospital two and a half months after the accident and in and out for four more years. I\'ve had 70-80 surgeries on my face and hand, the majority on my face. Add about 10-15 more on my leg, I never got the records on my leg, so that\'s more of a guess. The accident was 11/30/01.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1e4023/mitch_hunter_full_face_transplant/ - first ama with more explanation \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/srRLBHX\\n\\nSomeone photoshop/meme my pics, I wanna see your creativity!\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DeathIsScaredOfMe/ - verified blue checkmar\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Mitch.W.T.F\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Fifth0555\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xI4ne';;;;1466278861.0b'I am the Executive Producer of Planet Earth II, and Dynasties, Michael Gunton.

My relationship with debt started seven years ago after graduating from an expensive private school with $74,000 in student loans. \\n\\nI was told I would earn about $80k upon graduation, but I wasn\\u2019t able to find a job with a salary anywhere near that. Without steady income (and a terrible economy in 2009), I ended up defaulting on my student loans and my balance ballooned to $107,000. \\n\\nBuilding Student Loan Hero allowed me to help people who struggled in the same way I did. After a seven-year-long journey, I finally paid off my student loans (in full) three months ago. All $107,000! Now that my debt is officially behind me, I thought it\\u2019d be the perfect opportunity to share some insight into my six-figure payoff story. \\n\\nOur free tools, calculators, and guides are helping 100,000+ borrowers manage and eliminate over $2 billion dollars in student loan debt. Ready to ROCK this AMA!\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter: @josablack & @StudentLoanHero \\n\\n**My Proof:** http://imgur.com/a/7QbhC\\nhttps://twitter.com/josablack/status/822104543714508802\\nhttps://twitter.com/StudentLoanHero/status/822104766184558593\\n\\n**Update:** You guys are awesome! Obviously, I can\\u2019t get to all your questions. If you\'re still looking for help, feel free to [check out our website here](https://studentloanhero.com/) where you can get free repayment advice and find answers to your student loan questions. I will be wrapping this up around 5 pm EST.\\n\\n**Final Update:** Thanks for having me! I\'m exhausted, so time to call it quits. Many folks had the same questions, so I\'ll answer them here: \\n\\n1) SLH makes money the same way that Bankrate, NerdWallet, and CreditKarma do via performance-based advertising. This means we earn a commission when a customer decides to apply for a product/service. Everything on SLH is 100% free for users, although we do have some tools that allow you to "Pay What You Want" (and anyone can decide to pay $0 if he/she wishes).\\n\\n2) There is some confusing language in our [Terms of Use](https://studentloanhero.com/terms-of-use/). I realize that this outdated. Just to be clear, we have never rented/sold/leased any customer data nor do we plan on doing so in the future. Our team will be updating this legal language ASAP.\\n\\n3) Lastly, there is no magic bullet when paying off debt. It takes hard work, patience, and determination. I simply hope to make student loan repayment less confusing with some simple tools and resources that anyone is free to use.\\n\\nThanks everyone for sharing your stories/questions/and feedback!

Asleep on the side of a mountain, my three partners and I were rudely awoken by some men shooting at us. We were subsequently taken captive and held hostage for a week before we conspired to grab our then-lone guard and throw him off a cliff. Actually, Tommy Caldwell - of the current Dawn Wall fame - did the tossing. My other two partners were Beth Rodden and John Dickey.\\n\\nAlthough not exactly accurate in the strictest sense, this is the most concise version of the events that is currently available:\\n\\nhttp://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/climbing/rock-climbing/Fear-of-Falling.html\\n\\nThe book: http://www.amazon.com/Over-Edge-American-Climbers-Mountains/dp/0375506098\\n\\nClip from "I Survived": http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x118spu_i-survived-singer-and-his-friends-are-kidnapped-in-kyrgyzstan_shortfilms\\n\\nhttp://www.hulu.com/watch/504428\\n\\nThe guy we threw off the cliff, Su miraculously survived (I will never understand how) and John and I saw him six months later in prison. He was overjoyed to see us because we were the nicest people he had seen since the last time he had seen us. The conversation itself was somewhat awkward and we both apologized to each other and exchanged well-wishes.\\n* [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/gyDx95H.png)\\n* [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/MtMop30.png)\\n\\nA year later, in 2001, I had an even worse climbing trip when I was struck by rockfall on a remote mountain in the Canadian Arctic (Mt. Asgard, accompanied by Cedar Wright). After 57 hours camp-to-camp with no sleep and an immobilized left leg, I was feeling pretty unwell. On the 50km walk back to the ocean I started experiencing hallucinations and nightmares and was unable to figure out what was reality. Two weeks after I got home the events of 9/11 transpired and I, not ready to see Americans lose their minds about terrorism, got on a plane to Asia, fell off the planet for over a decade. I tried to forget everything I thought I knew, asked myself a lot of questions, and read a lot of books.\\n\\nHeavily affected by my experiences, I was not a ready or able to be a functioning member of society for a very long time and still struggle a bit. Finally, my wife dragged me kicking and screaming into a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym and my life has been steadily uphill since that first beatdown. I can now say that jiu jitsu saved my life. I don\'t feel like I have to be afraid of everybody everywhere I go, I can communicate and socialize again, and my confidence and motivation steadily grow as time goes by.\\n\\nI am now available for speaking engagements to share my story with others and my current contact is: www.jasonsingersmith.com\\n\\nI am happy to answer all questions that are composed in a thoughtful and respectful fashion.\\n\\n**EDIT** Since a lot of people ask about how I afford to travel. I had money from the book and movie for about 6 or 7 year, maybe. Money that made me extremely unhappy and that I didn\'t want in my life. I used to work for a month or two here and there when I would stop in to stay with friends in different places. I am a builder of all things: fabric, wood, masonry, electronics, leather, etc. so I\'m just a handy guy to have around. Especially if you have a lot of land that needs work or a house you\'re working on. I\'ve been in Australia for the last seven years and basically do the same, various odd jobs. We can afford to travel (these days usually three months in the winter) because we are *extremely* frugal. We don\'t spend money on crap and we don\'t have debt. Debt costs a lot of money to maintain and ties you down permanently. So the short story is that we have goal, that we know makes us happy, and we save until we get it.\\n\\n\\nAsk me anything!\\n\\nJason \'Singer\' Smith\\n\\n**My Proof:** [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WzPyNC5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: It\'s 3AM PST and I have to catch some shuteye.

For the past few months, I've been struggling to accept the reality of our situation. It's 11 years on, and I often feel like a failure because I still feel no closure after everything that has happened.When I was at school, teachers that were aware of what was going on would tell me that one day I would end up writing a book or doing something positive with my own experience. As the years have progressed, this has become harder and harder to motivate myself towards. I have had numerous conversations with social work regarding my concerns, written a lot of letters and even started a petition at one point. Each time, I have been pushed back or made to feel like a crazy and traumatised child. I am an adult now, but after being silenced and ignored so many times, it has become harder and harder to fight back and I have questioned my own sanity over the years.\\n\\n1,031,120 - is the number of domestic violence incidents reported in England and Wales during 2016. Just ONE year. I\\u2019m always uncomfortable sharing personal things, but when there\\u2019s a chance to make a difference and bring about change by telling a story I think that\\u2019s more important than my own fears. Some of you might remember a petition I created years ago, I must have only been about 14/15 at the time. My brother, sister and I were placed into the care of my grandmother after living in a home of domestic violence for several years. I started a petition because social work wanted to send my brother and sister back to live with my mother and her partner as they said they had no evidence the violence was still ongoing. The reason they had no evidence it was still ongoing is because my mum was under his control and would cover up what was really happening and I had hoped they would listen to my concerns and acknowledge the risk in sending my extremely young brother and sister back to live in this home. I was thrilled when my petition gained 1495 signatures and a lot of support from the public and messages from people opening up to me with similar experiences.\\n\\nSadly, social work ignored my petition and I was told that I could be in trouble with the police for my petition if I didn\\u2019t take it down and shortly afterwards social work went through with their decision to send them back to live with my mother and my violent step-dad. As a young teenager it took a lot of courage to speak out and I think having my concerns ignored by professionals for years and years has made me more fearful of speaking out as an adult and eventually I lost faith in social work\\u2019s ability to protect children.\\n\\nSadly, earlier on this year it was revealed that the violence has in fact continued on for years. However, my mum finally made the choice to leave my step-dad and charge him for everything he has done. The police have had the polar opposite approach of social work. Now there is a chance he may go to prison for the things he has done.I think it speaks volumes about the system that the police can hear about the horrible things this man has done and think there is a chance he could be locked up because he is a dangerous man whereas the social work department seen a suitable home for children. \\n\\nTheir decision to send them back allowed this violence to continue on in the presence of my younger brother and sister for years. It\\u2019s time the social work department stop playing happy families and putting their targets/budget before the well-being of the children they are supposed to protect.The whole system is a disgrace and it has taken a lot of courage to share this story but I hope if enough people speak out then it will bring about change and encourage people who have been in similar circumstances to speak out and get angry until it can\\u2019t be ignored. If you see/hear something that makes you worry about somebody\\u2019s wellbeing then don\\u2019t ignore it - report it to somebody. \\n\\nThings can\\u2019t go on like this.I am hoping by starting this blog and sharing my own concerns and experiences over the years, I may not only raise awareness and help someone else but may find some closure through writing about it.\\n\\nEDIT: Grabbing a cup of tea and then I'll work through all the questions and make sure I answer everything. I'm not feeling well so will be spending the night in bed with my laptop so keep the questions coming, I'll be here all night to get through them. :) \\n\\nEDIT 2: I am so overwhelmed by this response, I was not expecting this kind of feedback and all of you have made my evening and made me feel even more confident that I'm doing the right thing by starting this website. Like I mentioned in a lot of my comments, I am very new to all this and still getting used to things but I hope you'll all keep up to date with my posts and remember, if there is anything you would like to share then you can get in touch.

I bought four books off Amazon and spent the next few months learning how to program. Within 10 months, I got a prototype off the ground and sold it to a few big colleges. It was a synchronized [smartphone light show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ork4Q4eoUg4). It was adopted by fans quickly and soon started to spread throughout into the NBA, NHL, concerts, and even corporate events for companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Nissan.\\n\\nWhat makes the app unique or special is that that it doesn't use WiFi, Bluetooth, or Cell Service; instead, I designed a mechanism for network-free data transfer using inaudible, ultrasonic sound waves.

I also happen to be 17 years old. AMA!';;;;12123;;;;4kxgj0;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4kxgj0/iama_survivor_of_a_doublelung_organ_transplant/;;;;1094;;;;b"Hello, reddit! I recently joined reddit and I get a lot of questions about my situation IRL, so I thought maybe you guys would be interested too! I was born with a rare and terminal lung disease called Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and it eventually got bad enough that I needed to be listed for a double-lung transplant. After a year of waiting on the list, I received my transplant at the age of 14. \\n\\nAbout 6 months after the transplant, I started having severe stomach and back pain. At first my doctors shrugged it off as medicine-related pain, but when it got so bad that I physically could not get out of bed, they decided to hospitalize me. While hospitalized, I learned I had stage 4 of a specialized kind of non-hodkin's lymphoma that only happens after organ transplants called Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). I was 15 years old at the time of diagnosis. \\n\\nI had to go to live in a different state for 8 months to receive my treatment due to there being no specialists in my state or even any of the states surrounding mine. As you can imagine, this was very difficult for me.\\n\\nWhen I received my first chemo treatment, all seemed to go well.  I lost my hair, however, that was something to be expected. But about a week after I got the treatment, I started having extreme stomach pain (again!). They thought it was nausea from the chemo at first, but after a few days of me suffering in a morphine-haze, they finally opened me up. Turns out I had 10+ large intestinal perforations. For those who don't know, that means I had over \\x7f10 holes in my intestines and my liquid fecal matter was free \\x7ffloating around my abdominal cavity. During the surgery to fix this, the lead surgeon called my mom and asked whether or not she wanted him to proceed with the operation because he did not think I would survive. She said yes and so he finished it up. I won't go into too much detail, but after the surgery I went into septic shock and also developed a fungal infection, all whilst possessing about zero immune system. I spent a total of 3 months in the hospital, half of which was in the ICU. It was pretty much a miracle I survived.\\n\\nI had to have a temporary ostomy bag for 6 months to allow my intestines to heal. (The ostomy bag would break sometimes, especially during the nightime. Nothing quite like being 15 years old and waking up drenched in your own liquid shit.) Since I was getting my treatment at a hospital far away from home and in a very expensive city, my mother and I had to live in a tiny studio apartment. It was super hard and I actually don't remember much from that period of time since I was so traumatized I repressed most of the memories. I suppose that was a good thing.\\n\\nLastly, after I had my operation to reverse my ostomy, there was a medical error and they gave me too many fluids, resulting me in developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. I was on the vent for 5 days and they weren't sure if I'd make it. Despite this trauma to my (transplanted) lungs, I still have above average lung function today. I also had to do an entire year of physical therapy because one of the chemo meds totally fucked up my leg nerves and I was forced to relearn how to walk. \\n\\nIt's been a crazy journey, and a challenging one, but it's been worth it. I am alive and healthy today and for that I am forever grateful. I just finished my first full year of school since the 4th grade and even finished the semester with a 4.0. I'm a year behind peers my age in school (I just finished sophomore year) because I had to take a year off for the cancer, but that sure doesn't stop me. I have big plans for the future and nothing will get in the way of them!\\n\\n[Proof:](http://imgur.com/a/yMZbd) My scars and certificate of completion of chemo.\\n\\n\\n\\n";;;;1464171529.0b"Hey Redditors!

When I began writing a memoir about those years, I always had a sense that I should focus on my struggle to deal with the immense pressure of Olympics (I crashed and burned at my first Games in Athens before Beijing). However, as I dug beneath the events of my life during the creative process, I realized that I could not ignore a secret that, until recently, I have hidden from nearly everyone around me. \\n\\nSince I was a teen, I have struggled with sexual performance anxiety. It constantly affected my confidence as an athlete, and it is impossible to ignore that my relentless pursuit to become an Olympian was, in some part, motivated by my fears that I was not enough of a man. \\n\\nNow, I feel compelled to share my story, not for its own sake, but because I have long seen a trend in sport and culture that I think needs to change. Many men still run outdated mental software that leads them to equate masculinity with winning, materialism, and sexual prowess. And with so many young boys sketching out the map for who they will become as they observe the men around them, I think it\\u2019s high time we think about what they are learning. \\n\\nYou can read more about my story in my recent article for [Men\\u2019s Health](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a27255036/jason-rogers-olympics-fencing-performance-anxiety/#) or get updates on my forthcoming book at Web: [www.jasonrogers.co](https://jasonrogers.co/) / IG: [@jasonrogersusa](https://www.instagram.com/jasonrogersusa/) / TW: [@jasonrogersusa](https://twitter.com/jasonrogersusa) / FB: [@jasonrogers.co](https://www.facebook.com/jasonrogers.co)\\n\\nProof: https://i.redd.it/lpd5799hjfv21.jpg";;;;1556785993.0b"I sleigh like Santa, in spandex.

Happy Halloween!\\n\\nI\'m Jon Schnitzer, director/producer of "HAUNTERS: The Art Of The Scare" a film about how boo-scare mazes for Halloween have spawned a controversial sub-culture of "full contact" extreme terror experiences, the visionaries who dedicate their lives to scaring people, and why we seek out these kind of experiences - especially in scary and unpredictable times.  \\n\\nNo surprise this Halloween is projected to be the biggest ever and that these kind of experiences are starting to be offered year round.\\n\\nI filmed inside McKamey Manor, the most controversial extreme haunt in the world, infamous for going on for 8 hours, having no safe word and even waterboarding people. I also got unprecedented access to the creative geniuses behind Blackout, Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights, Knotts Scary Farm, Delusion and more traditional haunts too. HAUNTERS also features horror visionaries John Murdy (HHN) Jen Soska & Sylvia Soska (American Mary / Hellevator), Jason Blum (producer of The Purge, Happy Death Day, Insidious, Sinister), Jessica Cameron (Truth or Dare / Mania) and more.  \\n\\nI always loved Halloween and horror movies since I was a kid, so I wanted to highlight the haunters as the artists they are, to capture the haunt subculture at a time when more and more people are seeking extreme "scare-apy", and to spark a debate about how far is too far.\\n\\nBut, first and foremost, I wanted to make a movie that would entertain people, so I have been thrilled to get so many rave reviews since premiering at Fantastic Fest last month - "9 out of 10" - Film Threat, "An absolute blast" - iHorror, "Genuinely petrifying" - Bloody Disgusting, "Shockingly entertaining" - Dread Central, "An intoxicating study of our relationship with fear." - Joblo, and more!  \\n\\nHAUNTERS was a successfully funded Kickstarter project, that I made for under $100,000.  \\n\\nMy passion for this project also inspired some of my favorite composers and musicians to come on-board to create a killer soundtrack - Dead Man\'s Bones (Ryan Gosling & Zach Shields, who\'s also from the band Night Things and co-writer of the films Krampus and the upcoming Godzilla) and Emptyset, and an original score by Jonathan Snipes (\\u201cRoom 237\\u201d & \\u201cThe Nightmare\\u201d), Alexander Burke (recorded with Fiona Apple, David Lynch and Mr. Little Jeans) and Neil Baldock (recorded with Kanye West, Radiohead and Wilco).\\n\\nCheck out the trailers & reviews - www.hauntersmovie.com\\n\\nAsk me anything!  \\n\\nProof - link to this AMA is on our [Reviews & News](http://www.hauntersmovie.com/reviews/) page\\n\\nEDIT @ 2:48PM PST - Wow, I didn\'t expect to get so many questions - it\'s been a lot of fun and I totally lost track of time.

Imgur has grown and changed so much over the last couple years that it\\u2019s now a huge entertainment destination on it\\u2019s own, but it all started here on Reddit first.\\n\\nBack in 2009 I was frustrated with the state of image hosting on the Internet and thought that I could do something about it, and [that\\u2019s how Imgur was born](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting). It started as a simple hosting service, but I quickly learned that running a website wasn\\u2019t so simple of a thing. To find out what to work on next, I lived off the user suggestions I was getting. Every morning I\\u2019d wake up to a new full inbox of user suggestions to go through. Those suggestions eventually led to the "popular image gallery," accounts, comments, replies, messaging, notifications, apps -- all the features that make Imgur what it is today were at one point user suggestions. I was also lucky enough to have the [reddit community support Imgur with donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9nsoa/mrgrim_creator_of_imgur_is_barely_breaking_even/) (thank you!).\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t long before I moved out to San Francisco to start growing Imgur as a business, and within the first month, it won [TechCrunch\\u2019s Best Boostrapped Startup award](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/imgur-wins-best-bootstrapped-startup-sees-1-billion-pageviews-per-month/) ([and got a second one two years later](http://techcrunch.com/video/imgur-named-best-bootstrapped-startup-crunchies-awards-2013/518118899/)). From then on I started hiring engineers, improving the product, and focusing on the user experience. After another couple of years and growing the team to 12 people, we decided to take investment from the awesome people at [Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/). Since then, the small family that was the Imgur team has grown to a big family of over 60 people. [We\\u2019re now in a much bigger office](http://i.imgur.com/xB3Kh2Y.jpg), and whole teams are focused on different aspects of Imgur and we\'re all trying to make it the best place on the Internet to discover awesome images. \\n\\nThe vision for Imgur has expanded a lot since the beginning. What we\\u2019re striving to do now is lift the world\\u2019s spirits for a few moments everyday. This might mean experiencing things that makes you laugh, that makes you smarter, that makes you feel supported, or that makes you feel inspired. No matter what it is, you walk away feeling better and glad you were able to escape your day to day and reconnect with humanity. Everyday I see us fulfilling this mission with the [amazing](http://imgur.com/gallery/Q19lE) [stories](http://imgur.com/gallery/cZMCY) [that](http://imgur.com/gallery/tFLMP) [people](http://imgur.com/gallery/729Nj) [share](http://imgur.com/gallery/uibU7) [every](http://imgur.com/gallery/Uhr1JF5) [day](http://imgur.com/gallery/HTlme), and we even threw what we called [Camp Imgur](http://mic.com/articles/123956/imgur-s-alan-and-sarah-schaaf-look-to-the-future) to celebrate that.\\n\\nSome things that we\\u2019re working on now that have been challenging:\\n\\n* Scaling the infrastructure has always been a challenge. We\\u2019ve gotten really good at it over the years, but things are always evolving and changing, and unfortunately that also means we see more downtime than we\\u2019d like to. This is pretty much a function of hiring though. [We need more great engineers](http://imgur.com/jobs) to help us take our infrastructure to the next level. You can read more about our stack from [this blog post](http://imgur.com/blog/2013/06/04/tech-tuesday-our-technology-stack/) I wrote a few years ago. Most of it is still true, except that we have new services that aren\\u2019t listed.\\n\\n* The world is moving mobile and apps are hard to build. A lot of consumer companies were caught by surprise by the shift to mobile, but it\\u2019s the real deal. It would now be insane to be a consumer company to not have an app or a mobile optimized site, and we now see more mobile traffic than desktop traffic. To account for this, we\\u2019ve had to build 3 new teams this year to focus on mobile: iOS, Android, and Mobile Web. [I\\u2019m excited to say that we\\u2019ve released our apps](http://imgur.com/apps) earlier this year and they\\u2019re getting better and better, and we\\u2019re still working to improve them everyday. We now see half of all engagement on Imgur coming from mobile. But man, getting there was a big challenge and now we\\u2019re going to have to redo our whole API for the apps to scale.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve learned an incredible amount of stuff over years thanks to Imgur. From running a startup, to organizing teams, to scaling MySQL to go way beyond what it was meant to do.  I\\u2019ve spoken [at more conferences](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/imgur-is-the-anti-facebook/) than I can remember, and have even done a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jxiJzIiz4). Also, **today is my birthday!** So, please feel free to **ask me anything**, or give suggestions on how to make Imgur even better.\\n\\n*edit: proof http://imgur.com/pT3StKM*\\n\\n**edit again: Thanks so much for all the questions! I\'ve been answering them for almost 4 hours and it\'s time to get going.

Over the past 15 months, I have traveled to Winnipeg, Edmonton, Regina, Ottawa and remote First Nation communities such as Manitoba\\u2019s Garden Hill and Pinaymootang in search of compelling stories and answers to some of the big questions: What renders indigenous women so vulnerable? Who is perpetrating these crimes? What are police, governments and indigenous leaders doing about it? I have sat with grieving families who are still searching for those answers, and more \\u2013 many cases remain unsolved, including that of Tina Fontaine, the 15-year-old Sagkeeng First Nation teen whose 2014 death reignited calls for a national inquiry into the violence.\\n\\nMy colleague, Matthew McClearn, is a Globe data journalist who has been spearheading The Globe's months-long effort to compile and vet a database of homicide and missing-person cases involving indigenous women. We started digging into how serial killing fits into the broader tragedy of Canada\\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women about six months ago. Matthew obtained and crunched data from an American researcher, allowing The Globe to determine just how over-represented indigenous women are among Canada\\u2019s female serial-homicide victims.\\n\\nOur analysis revealed aboriginal women are roughly seven times more likely to die at the hands of a serial killer than non-aboriginal women. (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prime-targets-serial-killers-and-indigenous-women/article27435090/) The investigation also found that at least 18 indigenous women were slain by convicted serial killers since 1980. To illuminate the human element of all this, we recently launched The Taken, a multimedia project that traces the lives of five indigenous women slain by different serial killers.

People have been requesting me to do this for quite some time now, so I decided to give it a try! My name is Marina Amaral, I'm 22 and I live in Brazil. One day I decided to combine my fascination with history and skill using Photoshop by restoring and putting color into photos that were originally black and white, allowing people to see history from a new and colorful perspective. Each photo is made to be realistic by recognizing the value behind each one of them, respecting and preserving their stories, paying attention to the finer details and maintaining their original essence. Every completed work has gone through long and in-depth research and is supported by the opinions of experts in each particular area if necessary, to faithfully reproduce the original colors and atmosphere. My work ranges from simple portraits to complex and detailed images, taken from various historical periods covering a wide range of topics.\\n\\n\\nI've been doing this professionally for two years. I work with several publishers, magazines, TV stations, production companies, museums and institutions from different parts of the world. WIRED magazine has made an incredible story on me and my work, which you can read [here](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/marina-amaral-colorized-photos/). \\n\\nI'm working on several exciting personal projects at the moment and I'll be glad to share some of my thoughts with you!\\n__________\\nYou can have a look at my work here: [www.marinamaral.com](http://www.marinamaral.com) || [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/marinamaralarts/) ||[ Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marinaarts/)\\n_____________\\n\\n\\n**My Proof:** [https://twitter.com/marinamaral2/status/878685669580840960](https://twitter.com/marinamaral2/status/878685669580840960)\\n\\n__________\\n\\n**EDIT:** You can commission me to colorize family photos as well: http://www.marinamaral.com/contact/\\n\\n**Edit 2:** I've been answering the questions for 7 hours and will continue doing it tomorrow morning.

At that point I won\\u2019t be able to update you all here, and you won\\u2019t have a way to communicate with each other. \\n\\n\\nBecause of this, I have created a subreddit [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC_Hiring/)  where we can all keep in touch moving forward. It\\u2019s still a work in progress, but I hope those of you who are still going through the process from last year\\u2019s bid join as well as all the new folks from this year. This should make things much easier for everyone moving forward. I hope to see you all over on r/ATC_Hiring !\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE November 15**\\n\\n\\nTOLs for Pool 2 are now going out.\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE November 6**\\n\\n\\nWell that was fast. Keep an eye on your emails, as TOLs have begun to filter out.\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE October 30**\\n\\n\\nAccording to HR, TOLs should start going out within the next 2-4 weeks. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE October 29**\\n\\n\\nEverybody, check your **application status** on USA Jobs. AT-SA results appear to be coming in. If your status has changed to **referred**, it means you have passed the exam and *may* be receiving a TOL in the coming months. It will also tell you which band you scored in. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE September 11**\\n\\n\\nIf you took the AT-SA last year and never called HR to find out which tier your score fell into, now is the time to do so. If you scored \\u201cBest Qualified\\u201d, you do not want to test again as they will only use your most recent score. HR has confirmed that if you already have a \\u201cBest Qualified\\u201d score, you do not need to take any action at this time.\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE September 10**\\n\\n\\nCHECK YOUR EMAIL! The first wave of AT-SA invites have been unleashed. Don\\u2019t be discouraged if you haven\\u2019t received yours yet; they will go out in waves. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE August 30**\\n\\nI just wanted to check in with everybody who has been patiently (mostly) waiting for the next step. Unfortunately I don\\u2019t have any news for you, as I haven\\u2019t heard of any emails going out yet from this bid. This process is incredibly slow, and this time frame is not extraordinary. I will update the second I am notified that emails have begun to go out. As always, hurry up and wait. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE June 18**\\n\\nThe bid has closed. Expect HR to take around a month or so to process applications and get emails sent out for the next step. Monitor you emails aggressively for updates. If you meet the minimum requirements you *will* be invited to take the AT-SA. \\n\\n\\n**For those of you who applied last year and did not get a TOL:** You need to call and/or email HR to find out which band your AT-SA score fell in (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified). If you scored anything other than Best Qualified, my personal advice is to take the AT-SA again. I have confirmed with HR that the ATO will offer TOLs to those in the WQ or Q bands only after exhausting the BQ band. Note that they will use your **most recent** AT-SA score, so if you are already in the Best Qualified band there is no point in taking the exam again as your score can only go down. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE June 14**\\n\\n\\nThe bid is up! You can apply now by clicking [HERE](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/536694900) . Once the bid closes on June 17, HR will take *probably* around a month or so to eliminate applications from those who don\\u2019t meet the requirements. After that, everyone else will receive an email detailing the next step, scheduling your AT-SA exam. Good luck, and as always feel free to keep in touch with each other in the comments and shoot me a PM. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE June 13**\\n\\n\\nThe bid opens **TOMORROW**.

I\\u2019ll be back at it again today, answering any questions y\\u2019all still have. Feel free to comment to each other below and send me PMs with any individual questions. A few common questions I\\u2019ve been receiving:\\n\\n\\n- *When does the bid open?* \\u2014 The rumored date is June 14, but it\\u2019s not official yet. I will post the actual date here once it\\u2019s announced. \\n\\n\\n- *Do I get paid while at the academy?* \\u2014 Yes. The FAA per diem will cover your housing and food. You won\\u2019t be able to pocket the leftover per diem the way you used to. In addition you\\u2019ll make somewhere around $11/hr (someone at the academy now feel free to give me the exact number, it\\u2019s been 3 years since I\\u2019ve been there) to cover your bills back home. \\n\\n\\n- *Does the FAA pay for my moving expenses?* \\u2014 No. However you will get 64 hours of paid \\u201cchange of station\\u201d leave to give you a couple weeks to get situated in your new city. \\n\\n\\n- *Is there a way to see what facilities need people now? I\\u2019d like to stay near XXX.* \\u2014 There is a priority placement list, but it is useless to you right now. By the time you get your facility options at the academy the list will be completely different. \\n\\n\\n- *What can I do to make my resume stand out?* \\u2014 The hiring process is almost entirely automated. One of the only times a human will look at your resume is just to verify your job history and/or education. The best way to make yourself stand out against the competition is to score as high as you can on the AT-SA. \\n\\n\\n- *What do I need to do right now?* \\u2014 Follow this thread. If you want to be proactive you can go ahead and [MAKE YOUR PROFILE](https://www.usajobs.gov) on USA Jobs and set up your resume using the resume builder provided. Other than that, just bookmark this thread and keep in touch. I will handle this the same way I did last year by providing constant updates at the top as well as responding to all PMs.\\n\\n\\nHave a great day and I\\u2019ll see y\\u2019all in the comments!\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE 5, May 24**\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019ve managed to clear out all my chats and PMs, and it seems most questions in the comments were answered by myself or others. I\\u2019m packing it in for the night, but I\\u2019ll be back tomorrow to continue talking to you all. Feel free to send me any messages if you need more information. I\\u2019ll always get back to you guys.\\n\\n\\nLike I\\u2019ve mentioned, I will continue to update this thread similar to how I did it last year. As I get new information, I will post it as updates at the top of this thread, so be sure to follow. Goodnight Reddit, I\\u2019ll see y\\u2019all in the morning. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE 4, May 24**\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m still trying to get to everybody, even those of you who PM\\u2019d me last night when I first posted this. I\\u2019m working today and trying to answer what I can while on break, but I\\u2019ll be sure to get to everybody eventually. Buckle in, this will be a **long** process.\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE 3, May 24**\\n\\n\\nA member from FAA Personnel Security has joined the conversation with some good insight regarding your personal history. Below is a copy of their comment:\\n\\n\\n\\u201cAs someone who works in FAA Personnel Security I want to mention a few things here to save me time and you as well if you intend on applying:\\n\\n\\nThere is about a 50% washout rate in the ATCS academy. So half of the students make it to the next step.\\n\\n\\nAll ATCS go through an extensive background investigation with a NBIB investigator. You need to be honest and upfront in your answers on security documents and with the investigator. Don't think you can lie about your experience or education and not have it found out.\\n\\n\\nDon't apply if you've smoked weed or used drugs in the last few years and ever plan on smoking weed or using again. It doesn't matter if marijuana is legal in your state, it's still illegal federally and this is a federal government job with regular random testing.\\n\\n\\nDon't apply if you've had a dishonorable or general discharge from the military ever or have any currently delinquent federal debt this include student loans, taxes, mortgage. Make sure all of your debts are current and you've got payment plans going with proof of the plans and payments in writing.\\n\\n\\nDon't apply if you have any pending criminal charges (other than traffic citation related) or a recent criminal record within the last 3 years\\n\\n\\nDon't apply if you've been fired or resigned under the threat of being fired more than once in the last three years\\n\\n\\nWith all that said, it's an awesome job if you can get through the academy and probation/OJT. I didn't even know anything about it other than the stigma of it being so stressful (it's not) until it was too late for me to apply due to age. Otherwise I would've jumped on it. It's not that stressful and the pay and benefits are excellent. A large number of ATCS have friends and family also in the FAA, which tells me it's not a bad gig at all. Do keep in mind though, that it is a huge responsibility and if you make a mistake controlling traffic, hundreds of lives could be put on the line. It's a safety related position and not to be taken lightly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE 2, May 24**\\n\\n\\nI am in the process of adding the reference material from last year\\u2019s AMA to this one, but I am on mobile so it will take a little time. In the meantime, make sure to check out the \\u201cSTART HERE\\u201d link below. It has every bit of reference material I included last year.\\n\\n\\n**UPDATE May 24**\\n\\n\\nI went to sleep having answered everyone that had commented/messaged me at the time, and woke up to a lot more response. I will be getting to everybody whose comment wasn\\u2019t already answered by another helpful person, as well as every PM I\\u2019ve received.

There are people who saw my post last year, applied, and never got beyond the application process. Others got to the next step to take the AT-SA (an entrance exam of sorts) and never got a response from the FAA after that. Others passed the AT-SA and received a tentative offer letter (TOL) but are still going through the different clearances as we speak a year later.\\n\\n\\n- You will 99.9% have to relocate. The FAA does not care where you want to live. You will have limited options upon passing the academy that will be presented to you solely based on national staffing needs. There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren\\u2019t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. \\n\\n\\n- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. \\n\\n\\n*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You\\u2019ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it\\u2019s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you\\u2019ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.\\n\\n\\nThere are people at the academy *right now* who saw my AMA last year on Reddit, applied, and got hired. Solely for that reason I am doing this again. If anybody has any interest whatsoever in this, please don\\u2019t hesitate to comment and/or PM me.

Original [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6e6kqw/reddit_what_are_some_tips_to_make_16_hr_flight/) and [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6e6kqw/reddit_what_are_some_tips_to_make_16_hr_flight/di8ck2z/).\\nI got so many questions that I thought I might make an AMA! Feel free to ask me anything about them! \\n\\n**About me: **\\nI was born profoundly deaf, and got my first cochlear implant at 18 months old. I got my left one when I was 6 years old. I have two brothers, one is also deaf and the other is not. I am the youngest out of all three. I'm about to finish my first year at college!\\n\\nThis is a very brief overview of how a cochlear implant works: There are 3 parts to the outer piece of the cochlear implant. The battery, the processor, and the coil. [Picture of whole implant](http://www.cochlear.com/wps/wcm/connect/3d1ec3c3-ea7c-461f-b896-bf4e3becaebc/en_product_cochlearimplant_howcochlearimplantworks_440x386_70.5kb.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-3d1ec3c3-ea7c-461f-b896-bf4e3becaebc-l5rFjnr) The battery powers it (duh). There are microphones on the processor which take in sound, processor turns the sound into digital code, the code goes up the coil [2] and through my head into the implant [3] which converts the code into electrical impulses. The blue snail shell looking thing [4] is the cochlea, and an electrode array is put through it. The impulses go through the array and send the signals to my brain. That's how I perceive sound! The brain is amazing enough to understand it and give me the ability to hear similarly to you all, just in a very different way!\\n\\n**My Proof:** http://imgur.com/a/rpIUG\\n\\n**Update:** Thank you all so much for your questions!! I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but I'm sure glad it did! The more people who know about people like me the better! I need to sign off now, as I do have a software engineering project to get to. Thanks again, and I hope maybe you all learned something today.\\n\\np.s.

You might remember our colleague Greg from his [AMA on bees and pesticides](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3l2tbr/im_an_attorney_for_the_beekeeping_industry_who/). We\\u2019re Tim Preso and Marjorie Mulhall, attorneys who fight on behalf of endangered species, including wolves. Gray wolves once roamed the United States before [decades of unregulated killing](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-wolf-that-changed-america-wolf-wars-americas-campaign-to-eradicate-the-wolf/4312/) nearly wiped out the species in the lower 48. Since wolves were reintroduced to the Northern Rockies in the mid-90s, the species has started to spread into a small part of its historic range. \\n\\nIn 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decided to remove Wyoming\\u2019s gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act and turn over wolf management to state law. This decision came despite the fact that Wyoming let hunters shoot wolves on sight across 85 percent of the state and failed to guarantee basic wolf protections in the rest. As a result, [the famous 832F wolf](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/science/earth/famous-wolf-is-killed-outside-yellowstone.html?_r=0), the collared alpha female of the Lamar Canyon pack, was among those killed after she traveled outside the bounds of Yellowstone National Park. We challenged the FWS decision in court and a judge [ruled in our favor](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2014/victory-for-wolves-in-wyoming). \\n\\nNow, politicians are trying to use backroom negotiations on government spending to reverse the court\\u2019s decision and again strip Endangered Species Act protections from wolves in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. This week, Congress and the White House are locked in [intense negotiations](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/budget/2015/11/06/government-shutdown-could-still-lurk-budget-negotiations/75286682/) that will determine whether this [provision is included](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259699-poison-pills-in-spending-bills-threaten-our-air-water) in the final government spending bill that will keep the lights on in 2016, due on President Obama\\u2019s desk by December 11. \\n\\nIf you agree science, not politics should dictate whether wolves keep their protections, [please sign our petition to the president](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1809&_ga=1.222255199.677293821.1433786647).\\n\\n[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/fHlhKiQ.jpg) for [Tim](http://earthjustice.org/about/staff/timothy-preso).

I was being prepared for the invasion of Japan through the Marine V-12 training program. Perhaps my life was spared by the dropping of the atomic bomb \\u2013 but at what cost to others? My three college degrees were made possible by the G.I. Bill of Rights. College education in Illinois and Michigan resulted in a lifetime of education work in Michigan where I did everything in the public schools from teaching kindergarten to university instruction except driving a bus. **My real love however was being a junior high school principal in an inner city school** for the last 15 years of my 30 year professional career. And seventeen years ago I found a renewed life in the District of Columbia.\\n\\nThe only true trauma in my life came after 43 years of marriage when my wife died..

I have testified in US tax court, written several books and twice won IRS Civil Servant of the Year awards. I have a BS, MS and MBA and am currently a qualified mediator with the Minnesota Supreme Court. In my younger years, I also worked for the US Army Corps of Engineers and was a sewer inspector.\\n\\n**My Proof:** https://twitter.com/MikeGregConsult/status/523167713305583616\\n \\n**Context:** This publication was made to raise awareness and motivate voters for the upcoming elections. Congressman Darrell Issa, the wealthiest man in Congress and Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has investigated the Lois Lerner Tea Party concerns with a dozen investigations costing over $12 million and collected over 67,000 emails while not finding any illegal activity at the IRS. There certainly was mismanagement, poor decision making and inappropriate acts by the IRS. These should be addressed. However, while focusing on this headline-catching case, the Committee has lost focus and [severely underfunded the IRS](http://imgur.com/sLaKX6z). This cripples the agency hurts law-abiding taxpayers who want and need help from the agency \\u2013 it also allows identity thieves and criminals to go unprosecuted, all at the expense of everyday Americans.\\n\\n**Disclaimers:** While I can give my opinions on tax law and the state of the IRS, I cannot give you tax advice. I am open to other questions but am hoping to focus on the pressing political issues surrounding the current state of the IRS, its dysfunctional elements and how we can improve the agency for the benefit of honest US taxpayers.\\n\\n**Resources:** For more about me and other books I have written, you can visit my website at [MikeGreg.com](http://mikegreg.com/).

A few notable experiences include my North-Atlantic crossover (see here http://youtu.be/QMjgBsJETKA ). \\n\\nCurrently I am in St. Vincent & the Grenadines, and after that I will make my way up through the remaining Caribbean islands, and then onto Africa.\\nMy motto for this journey is "A stranger is a friend you\'ve never met before", and so far, I haven\\u2019t been disappointed. This trip is mainly about people, cultures, life, breaking barriers, and adventure. A good example of this was my interview with my good friend Alex, in Reykjavik (see here: http://youtu.be/4iKqSIPf1yc )\\n\\nDue to the compelling nature of this project, I have been given the honor of traveling as goodwill ambassador for the Danish Red Cross. Which gives me an added purpose to my journey.\\n\\nSo far it has been a great adventure, and day after day, I feel increasingly confident that I am doing exactly what I am meant to do in life. I would love to share my experience with the Reddit community, and it\'s a great opportunity to let as many people as possible know about this project.\\n\\nFeel free to check out my website: onceuponasaga.dk\\nOr like me on Facebook, instagram, and Twitter! /onceuponasaga\\n \\nTorbj\\xf8rn C.

It\\u2019s true that if you smoke enough weed throughout your lifetime that you\\u2019ll forget to grow old.  And these days pot has got me feeling younger than ever.  Recently I was the voice of Reddit\'s new mobile app [video](https://youtu.be/cCnTVd9nMoY), my character Yax in \\u201cZootopia" became a fan favorite and the movie went on to earn over a BILLION dollars this year, I\\u2019ve been touring with Cheech, tweeting, reposting amazing [art](https://www.instagram.com/p/BGw9GAauPXI/) from my fans on my social media, had an [app](http://www.smokemojis.com) reach #1 in the App Store, testing lots of weed, oh and I beat cancer for the second time.\\n\\n[Chong\\u2019s Choice](http://chongschoice.com) has launched in dispensaries to great success, and will be in over 200 legal dispensaries by the end of the month. I had no idea you could get stoners to [work](http://www.instagram.com/p/BG2om2WuPXk/) this hard.  Currently our success makes Chong\\u2019s Choice one of the top performing legal cannabis brands in the world.  We\\u2019ve also been receiving tons of buzz for our [design](http://instagram.com/p/BEHTfFLkPZE/) and attention to the quality of the medicine.  I personally test every batch, product, and I almost smoked it all before it made it on the shelves.  \\n\\nThe legal cannabis industry is growing so fast, and the progress we\\u2019ve made to legalization is amazing.  I keep hearing people saying that the industry is in the middle of our \\u201cPot Com\\u201d or a \\u201cGreen Rush.\\u201d I love to hear this. It is what I\\u2019ve fought for my entire life as an activist and I knew we\\u2019d get here.  Currently half of the United States is medically legal and Ohio became the 25th state to legalize medical marijuana just last week!  That means we\\u2019re halfway there and it\\u2019s highly likely that a Federal decision will be coming soon to make a huge reversal of the unjust laws which criminalized marijuana in the first place.  The news around the country and the world is incredible.  A city in Colorado recently announced they\\u2019re using $1.5 million in legal Cannabis tax revenues to help the homeless.  It\\u2019s amazing and surreal to be seeing this all happen and a dream come true.  It is important to point out though that the DEA still categorizes Marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug.  Pot is still placed in the same category as the most hardcore substances despite all of our amazing progress.\\n\\nCheech & Chong is myself and my comedy partner Cheech Marin. Over the last four decades we have released albums, movies and toured the world.  We are credited as pioneers of the legalization of marijuana and the popularizers of cannabis in pop culture.

These stages are segments of road, anywhere from a mile to over twenty miles long, which have been closed to the public. In the USA, these are gravel, but tarmac rallies exist elsewhere. (The French rallies we compete in are tarmac).>>The stages are separated by transit or liaison sections, which is just a fancy way of saying that the crews drive along the normal road, which remains open to the public.>>One-by-one, the crews start the stages (typically in one minute intervals) and drive as quickly as possible to the finish. Each crew receives a time for that stage, and all of that crew's stage times (plus any penalties) are added for a cumulative time, which decides the winner of the rally. There are also a handful of different classes to enter, depending on your car.>>Meanwhile, the co-driver must read a book of pacenotes, which tell the driver massive amounts of information about the road: corners, straights, crests, road position, and more!

I\\u2019m Maureen, CEO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I love animation and took a circuitous path to get here.  FF8 convinced me to pursue a career in it (though 9 is my favorite), but my parents told me I\'d be destitute if I worked in film and forbade it.  I was UI designer and PM at eBay, then assistant to Zach Braff and Joseph Gordon Levitt\'s talent manager, then got an MBA, interned at Pixar on the Toy Story 3 production team, then joined Zynga at the very beginning (crazy ride), became VP of games looking over the Farmvilles.  Still couldn\'t shake my first love of animation, so worked with my friends Dice and Robert from Pixar (and now Tonko House) on Totoro Forest Project, Sketchtravel, and then The Dam Keeper (2015 Oscar nom animated short).  I fell in love with VR when my game devs hacked animation into a headset.  Realized it was the future of animation and jumped head in.  In my spare time, I play Zelda (am a bit obsessive about collecting all the korok seeds) and hope one day Baobab will be so successful that I can ride Shadowfax in my own Shire.\\n\\n\\n**Eric Darnell** (Eric4Baobab)\\n\\nWhats up Reddit?! I\\u2019m chief creative officer and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I earned my degree in journalism from the University of Colorado and my master\\u2019s degree in experimental animation from The California Institute of the Arts. My first "real" animation job was directing a music video for REM ("Get Up", from Green). Over the past 25 years as a computer animation director, screenwriter, story artist, film director, and executive producer.  I was the director and screenwriter on all four films in the \\u201cMadagascar\\u201d franchise.  This was a DECADE of my life/career.  Today I\'m running into adults who say that the Madagascar movies were a big part of their growin\' up.  That\'s pretty cool.  Before Baobab, I directed DreamWorks\' very first animated feature film, \\u201cAntz,\\u201d which features Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, and Sharon Stone -- and yes, I got to work with all of them!  Woody Allen was amazing, had great ideas and had more stamina that almost any other actor I\'ve worked with.  When I\'m not at work I like to ride my electic fatbike, hike, go to museums, goof around on my guitars, watch movies, go to Hanalei Bay and I still play TF2 on my PC -- look for Mr. Peppertree.  Okay, I confess to playing Hearthstone and Clash of Clans, too. I got into VR after my future co-founder, Maureen, put a headset on my head.  VR is definitely something you have to try in order to fully understand.  Well, on that first try I was blown away and together, with Larry, we formed Baobab a few weeks later.\\n\\n\\n**Larry Cutler** (Larry4Baobab)\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s up Reddit! I am the CTO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I admit to being a computer geek from a very young age, using my elementary school\\u2019s PET computer to create Star Wars video games. I studied computer science at Stanford, and as a grad student did early VR research into two-handed interactions with 6DOF input devices (a topic that is now relevant 20 years later). I never realized that I could combine CG and storytelling until I watched Toy Story. So I began my career in computer animation at Pixar as a Technical Director on the films Monster\\u2019s Inc.,Toy Story 2, and A Bug\\u2019s Life. After Pixar, I joined DreamWorks Animation, where I became the Global Head of Character Technology, leading character development, animation workflow, rigging, and character simulation. I worked on a number of films including Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and How to Train Your Dragon. I left DreamWorks to be VP of Solutions at an early-stage big data analytics startup company Metanautix which was acquired by Microsoft. During this time I put on a DK2 and immediately fell in love again with the magic and promise of VR.  Maureen, Eric, and I formed Baobab soon after to redefine animation in this new storytelling medium.\\n\\n* Website: www.baobabstudios.com\\n* Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/baobabstudios\\n* Twitter: www.twitter.com/baobabstudios\\n* Instagram: www.instagram.com/baobabstudios\\n\\n* Invasion! 360 Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ0fKW5PttM\\n* Asteroids!

We are considered CODAs (Child of Deaf Adult) in the deaf world which meant that we are hearing children raised by deaf parents and fluent in sign language. \\nFast forward 6 years to the day our son Elijah was introduced to the world. We expected him to pass his newborn hearing screening just like all of our nieces, nephews and older sister before him... but he didn't pass. We were stunned and heartbroken, yes heartbroken. You would think that this news wouldn't be so bad for a couple who were raised by deaf parents but it wasn't that simple. We have first hand seen the struggles our parents faced with in unemployment, communication barriers and the fight for education standards among the deaf children. Don't get me wrong...I take pride in my parents and my unusual upbringing. The thought of my son facing those barriers was too much for my heart to bare. \\nWe initially ruled out cochlear implants as an option because we grew up thinking that it didn't work very well and the sound quality was sub par. Not to mention, we were also well aware of the strong opposition to cochlear implants, especially on children. It didn't take long for us to  learn that there was a lot of misconceptions about cochlear implants within the deaf community. \\nWe ultimately made the decision to pursue cochlear implants after doing endless hours of research and talking to other families. We announced announced to our family and friends that we would be exploring cochlear implants for our infant son. That sparked a lot of anger within our family. Half of our family members did not speak to us for about 6 months. Two of my husbands siblings have deaf spouses and our news caused a firestorm on his side of the family. My son was implanted at 9 months old and activated at 10 months old. Our family members ended up working through their differences with us after my son received his surgery. They chose to put aside their difference for the sake of Elijahs happiness. I think Elijah has definitely changed a lot of lives with his journey. \\n\\n[Elijah](https://youtu.be/QCUN7nOu54Y) is 2 1/2 now and he is doing amazing with his implants. He's has a fairly large vocabulary in spoken English and ASL. I still get anxious when deaf strangers see us out in public with our son. There are a lot of neutral/supportive Deaf folks out there but not very many are forthcoming about their support. My parents seem to be skeptical (but are supportive) about how well it works. They cannot hear him speak and so they tend to assume he's unable to hear speech. \\n\\nOne interesting piece worth mentioning is that my sons hearing aid [video](https://youtu.be/2XLBA4UX51k) went viral a couple years ago. That's a whole other can of worms we opened in the deaf community. \\n\\nAMA ";;;;1504520356.0b'IamA 92 year old woman from Stuttgart, Germany, and experienced Nazi Germany as a civilian.

Now I want to give you all the opportunity to ask questions to my grandmother. I think it is interesting to read different experiences. Their careers are similar to each other, that is just a coincidence though.\\n \\nI\'m sitting here with my 92 year old german grandmother. [Proof with old pictures of her and her family.](http://imgur.com/a/wINmg)\\n \\n \\nShe was a very active woman but her health condition worsened dramatically a few months ago. Now life is really hard for her, since she has to lie on her sofa the whole day.\\nBefore her memories get lost, I wanted to document them in an AMAA. She has already told me a lot of stories of the past, but I think there is much more to get to know. Her experience is very valuable to me and I want to share her knowledge with you.\\n\\nShe was born in September 1922 in Stuttgart, Germany, is now 92 years old and lived her whole life in Stuttgart. She went to basic school called \'Hauptschule\' back then from 6-14y/o and went to a sort of business school afterwards called \'Handelsschule\', where she learned stenography (shorthand) and typing with a typewriter fluently. Education was very expensive, her school cost about 100 \\u2018Reichsmark\\u2018 per month. Her parents were farmers like most of the people back then, and had to work really hard to enable her to attend that school. She was only allowed because her marks were the best in \'Hauptschule\'. Most of her classmates had to work in a nearby shoe factory or in the fields at the age of 15.\\n\\nAt this time she was first in the [Jungm\\xe4delbund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungm%C3%A4delbund) and then in the [Bund deutscher M\\xe4dchen \\\\(BDM\\\\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_German_Girls). She remembers everything as if it was yesterday. They sang folk songs, went hiking every Sunday, dressed well and corporate feeling was strong. They were also raised well-mannered. She said it was a great time, probably the best time of her life.\\n\\nShe turned 17, 3 days after war began in September 1939. She was committed to military service in an office of a factory of \\u201aBosch\\u2018 with huge typewriters. She had to type non-stop and her fingers hurt even though she wore protectors. She had to calculate and type bills of soldiers for items the soldiers bought during war. Her colleague had to go to war in 1941 and she had to learn how to use huge calculating machines within a few days as well. Later, she had to bandage wounds of soldiers from the front line in the same factory.\\n\\nLater on, Stuttgart got bombed many times by the Allied forces. Lots of people she knew were killed. Our house got hit by a 2-tons-phosphorus canister, enough to blow up the whole house and surrounding houses easily. Luckily, it didn\\u2019t detonate, but the pressure of the impact was so huge that it pushed everyone hiding in the cellar to the other wall. You had to open up the cellar on both sides, so that the pressure of the impacts doesn\\u2019t  tear up your lungs. The bomb hit our house right in the moment her grandpa finished making the second hole. (Yes, our house survived the war.)\\n\\nHer parents were not in the NSDAP, she knows that for sure, she thinks they were social democrats. Members of the NSDAP had many advantages and her family did not have them. Her dad had to go to war and survived. Her younger brother did not have to go to war, because he had chronic rheumatism. He died at the age of 35 due to his rheumatism, which caused a heart attack. \\nShe married a former SS soldier in November 1957. He fought in the [Battle of Monte Cassino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) and in the [Normandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy), where he was the only survivor of his battle unit by chance because he got stuck in a little crevice. He was in war captivity under the Englishmen, then shipped to New York (both cruel treatment), then transferred to Canada (very good treatment).\\n\\nMy grandma worked for the city of Stuttgart as a secretary until she retired at the age of 56 and helped a lot of people with their finances. She had a dead birth in 1958, then gave birth to a daughter 3 years later. Her husband died half a year before I was born in an immense misfortune. He was a painter and so sportive, that he could still walk up or down stairs on his hands at the age of 60.\\n\\nPlease be respectful and feel free to ask questions.\\n\\n**edit 05:52pm GMT +2:** Thank you guys for all your questions and responses, we try to answer as many questions as possible, but it is very exhausting for her.

I answered some more questions I could answer myself. I know lots of stories of my grandma and just reproduced them.\\n\\n**edit next day:** I\'ve gone through a lot of comments lately and noticed that lots of people accuse germans back then for not noticing what the fate of those poor Jews was. Please remember that they had no televisions, internet, telephones whatsoever. Their only sources of media were newspapers and radio, which both were heavily controlled by propaganda. Nowadays, brain-washing people gets harder and harder due to the Internet, but back then it was easy. Remember that only 25 years before WW II started, people went cheering into WW I, thinking that they will be back home victoriously by Christmas. You should reconsider your accusations and think of what it must have been like to live at this time. Many gave their lifes and tried to kill Hitler and bring war to an end, but they all failed. If it had been so easy, why would none of them have succeed? It is easy to accuse others while grabbing some popcorn and going to bed without fear.';;;;1430076709.0b'IamA former CIA Case Officer who recently revealed my career to my family and now the world.

Our 4 boys had grown up and left the house to start their own lives. We read Vagabonding by Rolf Potts and The 4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss. Those two books created a paradigm shift for us and helped us realize that we did not need to wait for our Cancer years and hope that we had the ability and resources to travel as we always wanted to. We spent the next 2 1/2 years purging, paying off debt, and creating an income online that was not location dependent.

We had no home as we lost that in 2008. Based on The 4 Hour Work Week we decided that we would need to create an income of 2k per month to live to our desired comfort level. Some countries it would be more and some less, hence the average. Whe we left we were not quite there so we had to dip into that savings some as we continued to work to get to that 2k number.  We are now at that number and are working on the savings and building additional streams of income that are more passive and take less effort. Writing a book. Amy already has and we are beginning to market that, a new drop shipping business and in the future yes, we hope to monetize our blog but it is not currently ready for that. Here is the break down on our income and it is all location independent as it allows us to move around as we desire. Teaching English 1200-1400 per month. this is based on about 15 hours a week. We can easily make 2k a month off of just this if Amy work more hours. Royaltees from a Moonshine we created and brought to market 300 - 500 per month. Consulting other startups and bootstrappers 0 - 500 per month. and reisduals from a network marketing company 300- 500 per month. We have basic health insurance that is designed for expats and people who live abroad and spend most of their time outside the US. We have term Life insurance that covers expenses associated with either of our deaths. \\n\\nThis decision was made 2 1/2 years ago with the blessing and encouragement of our children. It was then execution of the plan over the next 2 1/2 years to pay off all of our debt, free ourselves from our possessions and find a way to make money online.\\n\\nI have tried to answer as many comments as I could. Some from My inbox and other here on the thread. I am sure it is easier to respond to an AMA that it is to run one!

Consult with an attorney if you want tailored and specific advice to your particular situation**\\n\\nHello everyone! A few days ago, news broke of a woman who sued over 153 unsolicited telephone calls and [won $229,500](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/07/us-twc-robocalls-idUSKCN0PH2H920150707). \\n\\nWell, I was not her attorney. \\n\\nI am, however, an attorney who sues companies under that same law, which is known as the "Telephone Consumer Protection Act" (or "TCPA" for short). I posted information about this law in a couple of threads the other day (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3chbmb/time_warner_cable_owes_229500_to_woman_it_would/csvpp70) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3cjck0/woman_who_got_153_robocalls_awarded_nearly_230000/csw8lbf)), and I received a lot of questions, so I thought I\'d open myself up for questions here. I\'m based in New Jersey, but bring these cases nationwide.\\n\\n**My Proof:** Made a [quick blog post](http://www.glapionlaw.com/#!Reddit-AmA/cnoq/559ff6ef0cf286eab01fa2e1) on my website. \\n\\n**About the TCPA**\\n\\nThe TCPA was a law meant to protect people from unwanted telephone calls and faxes. It provides for an award of $500-$1500 *per call*. The rules are a little different depending on whether you\'re getting calls on your cell phone, landline, VoIP, or if you\'re getting junk faxes. See [this](https://i.imgur.com/8S2Z5rv.png) quick cheatsheet. Basically:\\n\\n* **Cell phones**: Prerecorded voice and calls (and texts) made using an "automatic dialer" are illegal without consent. For non-telemarketing calls, the consent required can be oral or written, and simply giving your phone number = consent. For telemarketing, consent *must* be in writing. Political callers and charities are not exempt. This law also includes debt collectors, even for debt you owe, as well as repeated wrong number calls.\\n\\n* **Landlines**: Prerecorded telemarketing calls are illegal without express written consent.\\n\\n* **VoIP**: If you pay per minute or per call, treat like cell phones. If pay monthly for unlimited (or free), treat like landline.\\n\\n* **Fax**: Unsolicited fax advertisement? Illegal. Faxes also need a detailed opt out notice, even if solicited. If not there? Illegal.\\n\\n*CONSENT CAN BE REVOKED.*\\n\\n**EDIT TO ADD** I forgot the do not call list. If you receive two or more telemarketing calls in a 12-month period to your cell or landline and your cell or landline number is on the do not call list, that\'s a separate violation, and potentially an additional $500-$1500 per call (meaning up to $3000 per call).\\n\\nOf course, **not all calls are worth suing about**. Many "companies" that continue to call are scammers spoofing their caller ID that will be impossible to track down and recover from. It\'s unfortunate. My short hand? Two of the following must be present to be worth investigating further: \\n\\n* the call must be from a live number (when you call it back it connects you with the company that called);\\n\\n* the caller or the person that answers at the number must identify the company; \\n\\n* a live company website.\\n\\n**With that said, happy to answer any questions you may have**. I am a daily redditor, so don\'t be afraid to ask questions even days or weeks after this AmA concludes.\\n\\nSide note: While I do practice in other areas (such as Fair Debt Collection Practices work), and I\'m happy to take questions on those, I want to first give a shout out to /u/1800NotFair who has previously done an [AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/38iu50/i_am_attorney_craig_t_kimmel_founding_partner_at/) on debt collector harassment.\\n\\n**Disclaimer** Nothing in this post or my answers should be construed as legal advice. No inquiries or questions should be construed to create an attorney-client relationship.\\n\\nEdit 1: I am working through all the questions slowly but surely. This is my first AmA and I\'m falling a bit behind but I\'m here. Where\'s Victoria? Oh wait...\\n\\nEdit 2: As of this edit (4:10 PM eastern), I am approximately 100 questions behind. But I\'m still plugging away\\n\\nEdit 3: 4:47 PM and I\'m 72 questions behind. Still going! \\n\\nEdit 4: Still here at 6:03. 270 comments behind. Good news though is my girlfriend decided to go get takeout for us since I have to answer your questions. I consider that a win. \\n\\nEdit 5: Taking a break to give my hands a break and eat some dinner. I will be back shortly.\\n\\nEdit 6: 6:43, back at it.\\n\\nEdit 7: I\'m still here at 7:47 but I\'m going to need to start being more selective in answering questions for now (and I\'ll try to come back and answer the ones I missed over the weekend and into next week). My wrist is actually starting to hurt. Please don\'t take offense if I don\'t get to yours tonight! \\n\\nEdit 8: 8:54. I\'m going to shut it down for the night, but like I said, I\'m a regular redditor, so keep the questions coming and I\'ll answer, and also do my best to answer the ones I missed. As always, don\'t hesitate to PM me or email me. Thanks so much for all the interests and questions.

I am the proud new owner of a mechanical heart valve, a pacemaker and an 8 inch incision. AMA";;;;10301;;;;dyhduw;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dyhduw/im_a_31_yo_survivor_of_openheart_surgery_to/;;;;739;;;;b"**Short version**: On Oct 16th I came into hospital (Johns Hopkins) to have my aortic valve replaced with a mechanical On-X valve via open-heart surgery. As a consequence of the trauma my heart took, I went into total heart block (3rd degree AV block) and had a pacemaker fitted. I spent 15 days in hospital. Thanks to the pacing wires inserted into my chest during the surgery, I was kept safe from an otherwise dangerous complication (complete AV block) that could kill me. The truth is, none of the doctors could tell me what my true heart rate was after the surgery, as even turning off the pacing led to weird effects. Even the electrophysiologists couldn't tell me what my real heart rate was, but it was likely <40 or some other absurd number, and therefore dangerous. The pacing wires kept me alive until a pacemaker was fitted on day 5.\\n\\n**Outcome:** I want to thank a wonderful team of surgeons, doctors and nurses for getting me through this ordeal. I am now at home recovering, am on blood thinners for life and will enrol in a new study to see if mechanical valve patients can take alternatives to Warfarin \\\\[can't disclose more\\\\].\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**My background of how I came to discover heart disease**: I had no diagnosis from birth, except I was always out of breath as a kid and never did the sports other boys could do. In 2004, at age 15, I was living in Latin America due to parents work.  I contracted typhoid fever (don't ask...) and was on antibiotics for weeks. One positive outcome of this was that I saw a doctor, who heard a heart murmur and advised me to get it checked. Fast forward to 2007, I was living back in Scandinavia as a senior high school student. A chance illness led me to a local hospital, a murmur was once again heard, and some imaging tests revealed a bicuspid aortic valve, as well as the suggestion of light aortic insufficiency. The bicuspid valve is a common type of congenital heart defect (2% of men, 1% of women), in which two of the three parts of the healthy (tricuspid) aortic valve are fused together. This type of CHD is usually associated with Marfan or other types of connective tissue disorders (BUT NOT ALWAYS). Bicuspid valves do not pump blood as efficiently, and so usually result in calcium build-up and restricted flow (stenosis) as well as regurgitation (blood falling back; source of murmur sound). I was advised to get my heart checked in the future...\\n\\nI moved to England shortly after in the autumn of 2007 to study chemistry. In my supreme ignorance about heart disease, late teenage/ early 20s arrogance, and quite frankly fear, I didn't get anything checked in Oxford, and I carried heavy suitcases (25 kg) back and forth Scandinavia and the UK. A ticking time bomb was building up inside my heart...\\n\\nFast forward to 2015 (8 years without medical check ups), after uni and a stint in France, I was pursuing a PhD in London and in denial about my heart condition. I chose to join a gym hoping to finally get fit. Within weeks of a bit of lifting, I developed a dull but constant chest pain that would not go away. I eventually called the NHS number 111 and spoke to the operator. I had to strongly ask him not to send an ambulance, so I walked over at midnight from my home in Borough/London Bridge to the A&E at St Thomas Hospital (in front of houses of Parliament). My complaint of chest pain was taken very serious, and I was seen around 3-4 am. Lots of racket that night, all kinds of stab wounds etc.. Upon hearing a very loud murmur, the doctor alerted the consultants on call, and most of his colleagues also came by to listen to my murmur. They decided to do an echo on me in the entrance part of the A&E... I was sent home... At 6 am, I get a call from the same consultant, to come back to St Thomas and bring some essential items of clothing, cell phone etc. I was terrified. Upon return, I was fast-tracked to a CT scan at 6:30 am, because there was a fear I might have a small tear in my valve. I was kept in observation until the morning team arrived. Luckily, there wasn't a tear, but talk of emergency surgery persisted. ... Morning consultant arrived, gave me a full diagnosis but luckily told me I was not going to have surgery yet... Diagnosis: A 4.9 cm aneurysm was present in my aortic valve, and I had moderate/severe stenosis (restricted flow) from a moderately/severely calcified aortic valve. The aneurysm is a dilation in the heart valve from the extra work the heart has to do to pump with a bicuspid (sick) valve, and results in a narrowing of the valve and constricted blood flow.\\n\\nI was monitored closely in the UK after that until 2018 when I left to America for research position. I found a cardiologist here and within 4 months, I was speaking to a surgeon. I received the email on a Friday night, I was told to see a surgeon as my aneurysm now measured 5.1/5.2 cm, and I had severe stenosis. From the surgeon's perspective, I was a problem. I was told in the US surgery in a small-framed person is recommended for aneurysms of 4.5 cm. I was given 2 months to sort out my affairs (I lived alone in the US, my family all in Europe), and get dental clearance for surgery.\\n\\n**Life lessons:** For me, surgery was the worst/most painful 15 days of my life and I would not want to go through this again. Maybe I'm a weak person \\\\[excuse the language\\\\] but I got about every kind of complication possible. Violent temperature swings (chills then fever), lost my voice completely (it has taken 4 weeks to sort of return), complete heart block, and 2 blood transfusions. Some people have a very easy time with OHS, but I really struggled. Age is on my side, so recovery has been quick, nevertheless. By week 3 I was walking 1 hour stretches outside, by week 4 I was seeing friends and going grocery shopping.\\n\\nThe blood thinners have been an added complication that required being on heparin drip and have my blood checked some days up to every 4 hours in hospital. While in hospital, I had a lovely line in my neck that was connected straight the vein that goes to the heart, which allowed them to extract blood easily, but once that was removed out of infection fears, I was being poked every 4-6 hours for 7 days. It was very painful. Outside of hospital: The diet for warfarin has been easier than expected, I avoid 6 kinds of greens completely and life goes on. Warfarin is no big deal, and I love the ticking sound of my On-X valve. I recently bought a wrist watch, to complement it.\\n\\nThe surgery has given me a second chance at life, and I feel supremely grateful for this chance. It's made me worry less about petty things, and helped me see the big picture. I hope it helps me be a better person than before, or at least to not take things for granted. **If you have a murmur, get tested. If heart disease runs in the family, get tested please. Aortic dissection is a scary, but real prospect with high mortality rate. Having a sizeable aneurysm and not getting it treated surgically can lead to aortic dissection.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nProof: from day of surgery scared beyond belief [https://imgur.com/a/oAciip8](https://imgur.com/a/oAciip8).

There has long been much doubt about whether it was even possible to build one large enough to solve practical problems. But when something is labeled "impossible", of course many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians eagerly respond with "[Hold my beer!](http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hold-my-beer-14.jpg)". QCs have an immense potential to make a global impact (for the better!) by solving some of the world\'s most difficult computational problems, but they would also crush the math problems underpinning much of today\'s internet security, presenting an unprecedented challenge to cryptography researchers to develop and standardize new [quantum-resistant primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) for post-quantum internet.\\n\\nWe are mathematicians trained in crypto at NSA, and we worked there for over 10 years. For the past year or so we\'ve been at a small crypto sw/hw company specializing in working on a post-quantum research effort, and we\'ve been reading a broad spectrum of the current research.  We have a few other co-workers that will likely also chime in at some point.\\n\\nOur backgrounds:\\nRino (/u/rabinabo) is originally from Miami, FL, and of Cuban descent. He went to [MIT](http://math.mit.edu/) for a Bachelor\'s in math, then [UCSD](https://math.ucsd.edu/) for his PhD in math. He started at NSA with little programming experience, but he quickly learned over his 11 years there, obtaining a Master\'s in Computer Science at the [Hopkins night school](https://ep.jhu.edu/). Now he works at a small company on this post-quantum research.\\n\\nJohn (/u/john31415926) graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Mathematics.  After graduation, he went to work for the NSA as an applied research mathematician.  He spent 10 years doing cryptanalysis of things.  He currently works as a consultant doing crypto development in the cable industry.

I had just written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Diamond-Mountain-Obsession-Enlightenment/dp/1592408613) and given a [Tedx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ctiqic5Be4&list=FL3PyxGKt94kLzVqkkjEgRFw) about another guru making similarly outlandish claims in the deserts of Arizona. That story ended in tragedy, with a man dying on his search for enlightenment. I thought Wim Hof was just another charlatan, so I got a commission from Playboy to set out to prove he was a fake.\\n\\nObviously, I was more than a little bit skeptical when I met Hof at his training center in Poland. However, within a few days, he completely changed my mind. I ended up meditating on the banks of a snowy river, melting the snow around me with my body heat. I learned to hold my breath for three minutes at a stretch and stand in the snow for hours at a time.  At the end of the week I climbed a mountain in Poland wearing only a bathing suit while the temperature plummeted to 4 degrees.\\n\\nThe [2014 piece in Playboy](http://www.playboy.com/articles/wim-hoff-endurance-mind-control) turned out to be a hit and I spent the next four years studying the method more closely and examining scientific explanations for why it worked. I interviewed top athletes using cold exposure and high-intensity training to maximize their workouts, and military scientists who are trying to make the perfect soldier. I delved into the anthropological literature on human evolution that suggested that our ancestors survived frigid winters by cultivating a vestigial tissue known as brown fat, which uses ordinary white fat to heat the body. Then I learned how to cultivate brown fat myself.\\n\\nI know that a lot of this sounds crazy. I thought so too. But as I learned more, I began to see results for myself. I learned to control my body temperature to such an extent that last January, I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro without a shirt--at a pace that was three times faster than almost anyone ever attempts--making it to the rim of the volcano in just 28 hours.  \\n\\nThere's a lot more to say, of course, [and](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7i3t0BFtNaIMm0tT1lWaWpwTDg/view) [a](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7i3t0BFtNaIX2pTYk5QNXNPOUU) [ton](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7i3t0BFtNaIX2lJb1daQ24xanM) [of](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7i3t0BFtNaIcmFrRkpaQXpPeTg) [peer](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.abstract)-[reviewed](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810780#t=article) [science](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7i3t0BFtNaIcmFrRkpaQXpPeTg) that I've barely touched on here. \\n\\nAll of this is in a book I just wrote called [What Doesn\\u2019t Kill\\nUs](https://www.amazon.com/What-Doesnt-Kill-Environmental-Conditioning/dp/1623366909/ref=la_B004DGGZCO_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481127071&sr=1-1)\\n\\nAsk me anything.\\n\\nLinks: \\n[My website](http://www.scottcarney.com/) \\nThe book:[What Doesn\\u2019t Kill\\nUs](https://www.amazon.com/What-Doesnt-Kill-Environmental-Conditioning/dp/1623366909/ref=la_B004DGGZCO_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481127071&sr=1-1)\\n\\n[Video trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YeIRMK_pXk) \\n\\n[Proof](https://www.facebook.com/169404543099978/photos/a.214991811874584.55827.169404543099978/1492342040806215/?type=3)\\n\\n**Update 2:27 ET** - Well this blew up didn't it?

As well, many students who attend SHS struggle to pay for school fees. If students can not afford school they are forced to drop out and start a job to try and go back to school at a later time. Expo\\u2019s after school Peer-to-Peer tutoring program matches outstanding SHS students with struggling JHS students to provide free tutoring in math and English. Over the course of a term, the JHS students improve on average over 100% in math and 80% in English.\\n \\nFive high-achieving senior high school (SHS) students are each matched with five struggling junior high school (JHS) students. Through activity-based learning, small group activities, in-the-moment feedback and extra opportunities for practice and review, JHS students reinforce their math and English foundations each week. The SHS tutors develop leadership skills, confidence in their mentorship capabilities and receive a stipend that helps offset the cost of their education. As well, at the end of the program, one SHS student is selected to receive a scholarship that can pay almost a year of school fees. \\n\\nAt Antoa JHS we run one of our peer-to-peer tutoring programs. The tutors come from Antoa SHS and the students come from Antoa JHS. They meet two times a week to learn in a fun atmosphere. Since the students are all local to Kumasi (the major town near our village) and near the same age, the middle school students are taught in the local language and their tutor is like an older sister or brother rather than a teacher. \\n\\nThe school serves a community of about 1500 people and most people in this village make their living as farmers.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to help our organization out, please donate to our fundraising campaign. Any amount helps. All money goes towards our scholarship and stipend program to help SHS students stay in school. You can donate here:  https://www.generosity.com/education-fundraising/exponential-education-help-us-reach-new-students--2\\n\\nWe are hoping to expand our program to more schools in the Ashanti Region of Ghana so we can help more JHS and SHS students stay in school (with scholarships and stipends to SHS students) and pass their classes and understand their courses (tutoring JHS students). \\n\\nI\'m here with our Program Associate, Charles Amponsha, who runs the tutoring program at Antoa JHS; SHS tutors Emmanuel and Sharifa; and JHS students Joseph and Georgina. \\n\\nAsk us Anything!\\n\\nLink to website: http://www.exponentialeducationprogram.org/\\n\\nWhat is P2P?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czdlyur-ZdE\\n\\nLink to a photo of us now: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5CO_R1CFj0PT1k5c0FIa2EzVW8/view?usp=sharing\\n\\n**Note: the paper says "Hi!

I grew up in northern Virginia, my parents worked in government. I went to George Mason University where I studied business management. I joined Twin Oaks when I was 23 because I lost faith in the underpinnings of capitalism and looking for a better model. I have stayed because over time capitalism hasn\'t looked any better, and its a great place to raise children. While at Twin Oaks, I raised two boys to adulthood, constructed several buildings, managed the building maintenance program, have managed some of the business lines at different times.\\n\\n[Proof this is me](https://imgur.com/9PMIYvv).

Cooking/cleaning counts the same as planning the annual budget. Also, you don\'t have to do the same job all week - your day can be a mix of indoor and outdoor work, you have freedom to arrange your day, and you can gain skills in a wide array of tasks and trades.\\n* Non-gender binary, queer and trans people are very welcome at Twin Oaks. People introduce themselves with their pronouns and a significant number of our members go by they/them.\\n* Verbal consent culture is very important here. It is not okay to touch anyone without asking.\\n* Nudity and partial nudity is allowed in some parts of the farm, such as in the sauna, swimming hole, on the hiking trails, etc.\\n* Our social norms prohibit using phones in common areas when other members are present, with the exception of a few cafe-style spaces.\\n* Every day we provide a home-cooked, plant-based lunch and dinner with options for special diets including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and no onions & garlic.\\n* Raising kids here is easier. Some of the time that parents spend raising their children counts towards their labor quota. Many of the kids are home-schooled or "[unschooled](https://www.naturalchild.org/articles/guest/earl_stevens.html)", and they spend more time outside than in front of a screen. The kids have no problem passing the state\'s annual standardized test to move onto the next grade level.\\n* We have a shared clothing resource called Commie Clothes, which is like a free thrift store. Borrow something and then return it dirty, and it gets washed and re-hung up.\\n\\nMore about [Twin Oaks](https://www.twinoaks.org/about-twinoaks-community/welcome):\\n\\nTwin Oaks is an [intentional community](http://www.ic.org/) in rural central Virginia, made up of around 90 adult members and 15 children. Since the community\'s beginning in 1967, our way of life has reflected our values of cooperation, sharing, nonviolence, equality, and ecology.\\n\\nWe do not have a group religion; our beliefs are diverse. We do not have a central leader; we govern ourselves by a form of democracy with responsibility shared among various managers, planners, and committees. We are self-supporting economically, and partly self-sufficient. We are income-sharing. Each member works 42 hours a week in the community\'s business and domestic areas. Each member receives housing, food, healthcare, and personal spending money from the community.\\n\\nWe have open-slots and are accepting applications for new members. All prospective new members must participate in a [three-week visitor program](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/visitor-program). Applicants to join must leave for 30 days after their visit while the community decides on their application.\\n\\nWe offer a $5 tour on Saturdays of the property, starting in March. [More info here.](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/saturday-tours)\\n\\nAsk me anything!\\n\\nTL;DR: Opted out of the rat-race and retired at 23 to live in the woods with a bunch of hippies.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the questions! If you want some photos of the farm, you can check out our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/twinoakscommunity/?hl=en).\\n\\nEDIT2: I\'m answering new, original questions again today. Sort by new and scroll through the trolls to see more of my responses.\\n\\nEDIT3: We DO have food with onion & garlic! At meals, there is the regular food, PLUS alternative options for vegan/vegetarian/no gluten/no onions & garlic.\\n\\nEDIT4: Some of you have been asking if we are a cult. No, we are not. We don\'t have a central leader or common religion. Here are [characteristics](http://cultresearch.org/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/) of cults, FYI.\\n\\nEdit: Yikes!  Did I mention that I am 60?  Reddit is not my native land.  I don\'t understand the hostile, angry and seemingly deliberately obtuse comments on here.  And Soooo many people! \\n\\nAnyway, to the angry crowd: Twin Oaks poses no threat to anyone, we are 100 people out of a country of 330 million?  Twin Oaks reached its current maximum population about 25 years ago, so not growing fast, or at all. Members come and go from Twin Oaks.  There are, my guess is, 800 ex-members of Twin Oaks, so we aren\'t holding on to everyone who joins\\u2014certainly, no one is held against their will.  \\n\\nTwin Oaks is in rural Virginia, but we really aren\'t insular, isolated, gated or scared of the mainstream culture. We have scheduled tours of the whole property. Local government officials, like building inspectors, come to Twin Oaks with some frequency. People at Twin Oaks like to travel and manage to do so. I personally, know lots of people in the area, I am also a runner, so I leave the property probably every day. There are lots of news stories about Twin Oaks over the years.  If you are worried about Twin Oaks, maybe you could go read what the mainstream  (and alternative) media have to say.\\n\\nExcept about equality Twin Oaks is not particularly dogmatic about anything.  (I know some people at Twin Oaks will disagree with that statement.)  Twin Oaks isn\'t really hypocritical about Capitalism, Socialism, or Communism, we just don\'t identify those concepts as something that we are trying to do.  Twin Oaks is not trying to DO Communism, we are trying to live a good life with equally empowered citizens\\u2014which has led us to try to maintain economic parity among members.  Communists also do that. In making decisions in the community I don\'t remember anyone trying to support or oppose an idea due to excess or insufficient Communism, Socialism, or Capitalism. In most practical senses those words aren\'t useful and don\'t mean anything.  So, no need to hammer Twin Oaks for being insufficiently pure, or hypocritical.\\n\\nTwin Oaks is very similar to the Kibbutz in Israel. If anyone has concerns or questions about what would happen if places like Twin Oaks suddenly became much larger and more common, read about the history of the Kibbutz, which may have grown to possibly 1% of the population at their largest?  There was and is no fight with Capitalism from the kibbutz\\u2014or with the State.  My point is\\u2014not a threat.\\n\\nTo the other people who think that the ideas of Twin Oaks are interesting, I want you to know it is possible to live at Twin Oaks (or places like Twin Oaks) and happily live ones entire life.  There is no central, critical failing that makes the idea not work. And plenty of upside. But do lots of research first.  Twin Oaks maintains a massive web site.  (Anyway, it takes a long time to read.)  \\n\\nBut what I would like to see is more people starting more egalitarian, income-sharing communities.  I think that there is a need for a community that is designed and built by families, and who also share income, and provide mutual support with labor and money. If you love this concept, maybe consider gathering together other people and starting your own.\\n\\nIdeologically speaking:\\n\\n\\\\-Ecology: the best response to ecological problems is for humans to use fewer resources.  The easiest way to use fewer resources is to share resources. Living communally vastly cuts down on resource use without reducing quality of life. \\n\\n\\\\-Equality: ideologically speaking, most people accept the idea that all humans have equal rights, but most social structures operate in ways that are fundamentally unequal. If we truly believe in equality then we ought to be willing to put our bodies where our ideology is.  In a truly equal world, the issues of sexism and racism and all other forms of discrimination would, essentially, not exist.\\n\\n\\\\-Democracy: Twin Oaks uses all manner of decision-making models and tools to try to include everyone and to keep people equally empowered.  There is no useful word for this. We do use a majority vote sometimes, as a fallback.  But sometimes we use consensus.  We sometimes use sociocracy (dynamic governance). The word "Isocracy" (decision-making among equals), would be useful to describe Twin Oaks\' decision-making model, but Lev in Australia has written an incomprehensible "definition" on Wikipedia, that he keeps changing back when someone corrects it.\\n\\n\\\\-Happiness: The overarching goal of all ideologies is to make people happy, right?  I mean, isn\'t it? Capitalism is based upon the belief that motivation is crucial to human aspiration and success (and therefore more happiness).  Under Capitalism, equality is a detriment because it hinders motivation  (less fear of failure, or striving for success). Twin Oaks believes that humans are happier when they are equal, and equally empowered. So the place to start up the ladder of happiness is to first make everyone equal.  Well, Twin Oaks is mainly still working on that first step.\\n\\nEDIT5: Some have asked about videos - here are links to documentaries about Twin Oaks by [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7in_Iqnqjo), [VICE](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/have-you-ever-wanted-to-drop-out-of-capitalism/59c55d0ce0c06cfb6eaaa3ef) and [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIvSltuY_k).';;;;1582843382.0b'Hi, I\\u2019m Dr. Daniel Amen, psychiatrist and brain disorder specialist.

I thought for AMA\'s, you make a post, wait a few hours, then come back and answer questions. I made top ten worst AMAs lol. I\'ll try to do it right this time.\\n\\nHey everyone! My name is Jason Chan. I am what you call an ABC, American born Chinese. I look Chinese, but knew nothing about China until living there. I am doing this AMA because I am looking for people who would like to join my team there.\\n\\nProof and Photos of my gyms! [https://imgur.com/gallery/GJUCaxD](https://imgur.com/gallery/GJUCaxD)\\n\\nBio - I started exercising when I was about 11 years old. Growing up it was pretty much the only hobby of mine. I started with just pushups and sit-ups and as I got older I expanded my horizons. A few years back, I visited China and realized it was difficult to find a gym. Then I realized the food wasn\\u2019t very healthy, nor were there any real fit people, unlike in the USA where going to the gym was part of a normal lifestyle. I felt China was growing at a rapid pace and I wanted to be a part of this rapid growth. I feel if I can workout, then the Chinese people can do it as well. Americas way of training is different than the Chinese way And that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m here.\\n\\n2014 - I sold my car and took whatever cash I had to start the business. We were a small team of 3 people, basically a girl I met at a bar (who liked me) and her girlfriend. We opened in a very old building to keep rent costs low.\\n\\nOnce opened, it was hilarious as no one really came the first couple of months (hilarious now, extremely stressful then). Our way of reaching the market included word of mouth referrals, handing out flyers on the street, talking to strangers at coffee shops, massage salons, nail salons, and nightclubs. I even went on a Chinese dating show to try to get my name out.\\n\\nDating Show: [https://youtu.be/uaym34EAVA0](https://youtu.be/uaym34EAVA0)\\n\\nAfter about two to three years, the business was finally doing well. It was almost automatic, whereas I didn\\u2019t have to be there that much. So what happened? Relationships man, I can\\u2019t imagine what Johnny Depp and Tiger Woods went through. She constantly threatened to close the business down and it eventually happened. However, even though I closed, I knew the system I had was feasible. And others who saw my gym run as well. Also at this time, I wanted to work with others, because I was doing it on my own for the last 2-3 years. It felt lonely.\\n\\n2017 - This was the year where Beijing had a surge of fitness centers all over the city. I knew this guy, let\\u2019s just call him Mr.A. He wanted to open a coffeeshop/bar/something to do for his family. The space was three floors and he offered me the basement to run classes. I was a minority partner and couldn\\u2019t make business decisions. He dropped a ton of cash to get it running. Mr. A has money, but he let his family, who didn\\u2019t have experience, make business decisions. From construction to operations, it just wasn\\u2019t executed well. After about a year, the overhead of the coffeeshop was just too high and resulted in closing.\\n\\n2018 - Another guy, lets call him Mr. B, wanted to get on the bandwagon. He was living in an \\u201coffice space\\u201d life (Which I\\u2019ve also been through myself) and approached me to run a gym with him. We tried to establish in the center of a business district and the rent was much higher than my first gym. I warned him that we should be minimalistic, but he wanted to be \\u201chigh class\\u201d. I was also a minority partner and I couldn\\u2019t make business decisions for this gym as well. He thought he would have a lot of \\u201cfriends\\u201d to back him up. The planning for this gym was too hastily and after about six months, we ended up closing because we ran out of cash.\\n\\n2019 - So what did I learn from this? That I need to be in control. Allow others to give business advice, but the decision must be made on your own. And that\\u2019s what I did. I opened a minimalistic gym located between the three previous gyms.\\n\\nReddit is my homepage, and I love going on here for knowledge. It just came to me to do this. Can you believe it? I\\u2019m so slow.\\n\\nChinese people don\\u2019t understand the true nature of living a healthy lifestyle and/or the functionality of fitness. Thats probably the main reason for the causes of the current Wuhan epidemic. We can help them. If you feel you can improve my strategy, maybe we can work together!\\n\\nHere were some of the questions asked from the previous AMA.\\n\\n* How\\u2019s the air quality these days with lots of people working from / otherwise staying home?\\n* How often do you get out of the city? What are some of your favorite places to visit in China?\\n* What are some food chains operating in the country that you think are getting it right in terms of keeping their food relatively healthy?\\n* How was CNY? Did you go anywhere for the holiday?\\n\\n**Air quality is hit or miss, some days its really good and some days its really hazy. I\'m a city guy so I don\'t come out often. I do enjoy going to South Korea occasionally since its very close to me, about 1-2 hours away flight. There\'s a restaurant chain here that has insanely good customer service called Haidilao Hotpot. They treat their customers like they are kings and queens.  For CNY, most Chinese people go back to their hometowns so Beijing is very quiet compared to the usual craziness. I usually stay here because I like the uniqueness of it, a week of peacefulness in the city.**  \\n\\nHas coronavirus hurt business? I\'d imagine gyms are one of the places most affected since everybody is touching the same stuff and using the same equipment.\\n\\n**Coronavirus has basically kept everyone at home, not many people come out right now to keep the infection from spreading. All gyms are not running right now until things get better, hopefully by the end of this March. Which gave me some time to run this AMA.**\\n\\ndude, i\'m chinese, born and raised in los angeles, with basically the same amount of chinese comprehension as you on the dating show. my parents watch that stuff all the time, and joke about getting me up there. i can\'t see myself doing it (honestly i can\'t even sit through one of their episodes before they get to the sappy music and heart-to-heart stuff before i bail), but i am curious about the experience. can you talk about what that was like?\\n\\n**It was pretty fun. I knew someone who happened to be on the show and I just asked if I could go on it. They gave me an interview and saw I didn\'t speak Chinese and they knew exactly how to make that episode entertaining, by putting a white guy who speaks fluent Chinese next to an asian guy who doesn\'t speak it at all**\\n\\nTraditional Chinese foods and lifestyle are actually quite healthy\\u2014do you find that those traditions have been completely lost as the lifestyle becomes most rigid (996 work schedule) and there literally is not time to prepare food? Does anyone want to \\u201cgo back to the village\\u201d?\\n\\n**I wouldn\'t say I have no time to prepare food. I can prepare it on my own or I can hire a nanny to take care of it. It\'s cheap to hire a chef in China (less than $10 a day), cheap to have groceries delivered to you, and cheap ordering meals (less than $1 each time). I definitely wouldn\'t "go back to the village". Some of those traditions are healthy, and some aren\'t healthy.**\\n\\nHa! Have you ever had a Shanghainease breakfast? The traditional foods are ridiculously unhealthy.\\n\\nI\'m sure a McDonald\'s brekkie is better!\\n\\n**I\'ve tried them all, it really depends on how its prepared. Shanghai food is a little sweeter than Beijing food, same goes with their personality haha**\\n\\nDo you really believe it is a Chinese lack of fitness which made for the outbreak of the corona virus? Why would fitness level make someone a better host? I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m buying that one.\\n\\n**Fitness is only a small part to it. It\'s more important to just be aware of "healthy", whatever it is each person is doing. Such as not smoking as much or not at all, drinking and eating in moderation, and small exercises. China is one of the countries with the most smokers. The corona virus has been affecting mainly those with weaker immune systems and the elderly because, in my opinion, I think they can\'t fight them off.**\\n\\nI rarely see out of shape Chinese people. I figured the food was healthy. What keeps them looking in shape if they don\\u2019t work out or eat healthy?\\n\\n**(Took this from other users who explained it perfectly) "Out of shape" does not mean "fat." It means just a bit of exercise gets you winded and requires you to stop. Just because most Chinese people aren\'t fat doesn\'t mean they could run a mile. Fat skinny. They are not toned. You can be non obese and still suffer from high blood sugar, high blood pressure. A lot of the Chinese I have bumped into while traveling overseas are incredibly unhealthy. Like chain smoking, alcoholics eating tons of red meat while doing no exercise.This one Chinese young man was too physically weak to go scuba diving as he couldn\'t support the equipment as he had no body strength. Ive met a lot of international students from China as the uni, and honestly speaking, they would either eat very little or just starve themselves on some days. Especially the girls, their idea of beauty is keeping slim or straight up skinny. Otherwise, they\'d receive fat shaming via social media**\\n\\nU okay?\\n\\n**Yes thanks for asking!**\\n\\nIt\'s my understanding that non-Chinese citizens are unable to own property or businesses in China. How are you managing the ownership aspect of your current gym and maintaining enough control to keep the gym running how you know it needs to?\\n\\nWhat\'s been your strategy to attract people to your business amid a wave of other fitness centers? Do you think your being an American is a significant draw?\\n\\n**The biggest cost for the gym is rent. We simply try to gather enough people to cover that.  Everything else is minimal. A gym can be anywhere, but I think what makes our gym unique is the people. Most Chinese people are not very open to talk, unlike it is in America where you can usually have a conversation with anyone. Our gym kind of trains the Chinese people to be more open to talk.** \\n\\nIs it easy to get a Visa to stay in China as a small business owner? How often do you have to renew it?\\n\\n**I went through an agency. Renewal every year**\\n\\nYou gonna try another AMA in the future?\\n\\n**Tried it now haha!**\\n\\nFitness facility, healthy food training, and bicycle repair shop seemed like three great business ideas that would thrive in China (I got to visit a few years ago). Great job getting set up! How did you get such a good looking group of clients?\\n\\n**Anyone can be good-looking, its all in the personality**\\n\\nWhat are you going to implement in 2020? Possible expansion or different programs?\\n\\n**I don\'t know... thats why I\'m here for some opinions of redditors.**\\n\\nObviously there\\u2019s a lot of propaganda both ways between China and the west. What examples have you seen where the west have it completely wrong?\\n\\n**There are so many things! But I think the countries do things differently because they\'re  involved in different environments. So I wouldn\'t say one is better than the other.**\\n\\nHow do you feel with the Asian mindset of women who workout would turn too bulky? & Women having to be skinny, and the unhealthy habits that they develop because of that? (ie. not eating) How are you helping to reshape their way of thought at your gym?\\n\\n**Yes you are right! Most girls feel they would turn bulky. We try to teach them that its not really about being more skinny or most muscular to be beautiful, but more of being the most optimal version of you. We mostly make sure they are capable of doing everyday things, run and lift a little bit without getting injured. We would discuss examples of some American shapes such as Scarlett Johansson and Beyonce and that thin is not the only way.** \\n\\nIs the coronavirus in the way of business?\\n\\n**I think it became a wakeup call that something was not right. A lot of people learned to WASH THEIR HANDS and COVER THEIR SNEEZES. Hopefully it will keep getting better to bring awareness of each individual**\\n\\nWhat is in your opinion the most toxic part of the Chinese culture?\\n\\nWhich is the best?\\n\\n**Like anywhere, it really is a dog eat dog world out here. In China, it really shows. The best thing about being in China is that you can get anything at a fraction of a price than anywhere else. For example, there\'s a massaging gun that professional athletes use which cost about $500 USD and you can get something similar to that without the brand attached for 10% of that price.**\\n\\nI live in Beijing and have been looking for a reasonably priced place to work out. Which area is your latest gym in?\\n\\n**It\'s in Jiulongshan. I\'ll DM you the details**\\n\\nHow\\u2019s your dating life like in Beijing as opposed to in the states?\\n\\n**I feel people have a better chance of finding someone right for them because there are more people, hence more opportunities.** \\n\\nHow is the gym currently doing? I feel like to get people to work with you, you\\u2019ll need to provide a lot more information than you\\u2019ve provided so far. But I\\u2019m in finance so I\\u2019m probably biased.\\n\\nSeparately, how hard is it to move there and work without knowing the language? My girlfriend is from shanghai and we\\u2019ve talked about moving there but just assume it\\u2019s too difficult a transition.\\n\\n**You\'re  right, I actually don\'t even know what I\'m looking for right now. The gym right now is closed, kind of like the city. It\'s in quarantine because of the virus. I feel like I\'m in the movie contagion. It was hard at first not knowing the language, I had to use a phone for translation and relied on hand signals to communicate. Now its actually much easier! I encourage you to give it a shot in Shanghai, I think it\'ll be worth it.**\\n\\nWatched the whole show!Didnt understand most of it but fuck it.Why did you chose that last girl,she was the last one i would pick.I would chose that girl in red in the top 3.What happened with you and that girl?\\n\\n**It was hard to see haha!

Best of your luck with the business!\\n\\n**My Chinese was 0, speaking reading and writing together. If you\'re going to come, I suggest you go with someone who has already lived here a little bit, otherwise you\'re going to get scammed left and right. Sometimes when I come back to America I struggle with being patient to people. Like for example, if you were driving and there was someone trying to walk across the road, you would normally wait for them to pass before you drive. but in china you really can\'t wait for people to pass, because if you do, you\'d be waiting all day! It\'s pretty nice as a foreigner here when you\'re with the right people. But that could be anywhere. You just gotta find those right people**\\n\\nIs the government doing anything about all that public spitting?\\n\\n**They recently started banning smoking in buildings a couple years back, it was a good move. Hopefully they will do something about spitting after this epidemic.** \\n\\nWhat percent of those girls would you say you\\u2019ve plowed?\\n\\n**I wouldn\'t say plowed.

How is weightlifting seen in China and is barbell lifting becoming more popular?\\n\\n**They were always popular to begin with. My gym has a different view than their training regime. We train to just be functional for everyday things, the heaviest weight we have is about 30 pounds, while they are just training to lift as much weight as possible.**\\n\\nWhy china?\\n\\n**I had a finance job back in Las Vegas when I first graduated college, money was good and stress was minimal but I felt like I wasn\'t using my full potential. It felt like "office space". I would go partying a lot at night in the clubs because it was my escape. Met a lot of different kinds of people, and one guy suggested I give international a try.** \\n\\nHow was your day?\\n\\n**Probably going to be at home again because of the quarantine haha. its been like this for about a month now.**\\n\\nThere are a lot of female "influencers" from China chasing the western "ideal" physique of large breasts (implants) and thicc glutes.\\n\\nHas the general Chinese population adopted this trend, or do you still see more people trying to achieve the other ideal of being stuck thin?\\n\\n**(Took this answer from another user because he said it right on point) Not op but I spend half my life in China and half my life in NA. I can tell you with confidence that the beauty standard in China is still drastically different from that of the US. People still prefer thin, lean body type for both men and women. Body types from Kim Kardarshian or Dwayne Johnson are considered \\u201ctoo much\\u201d for Chinese beauty standard (or East Asian beauty standard in general).**\\n\\nHow do you get around in China using an online map and which one do you use?

Sorry that was a typo.** \\n\\nhow fake was that dating show? that show is playing in the room every day here. i usually see it in an app, and your youtube clip is much clearer. the makeup and plastic surgery on the models is much more obvious. so sad to see that kind of work on such young women.\\n\\nyou look pretty uncomfortable. how good is your chinese? did you approach the show, or did they find you? did you choose your own clothes? were your clothes chosen just so you could lift up your shirt? how much of the set is really there, and how much is just green screen?\\n\\ninteresting that you had extended interactions with the "international" models. usually they don\'t say much.\\n\\ndid you have free choice? at a point, you and the emcee seem to be looking down for a prompt.\\n\\ndo you watch ramsey dewey\'s youtube channel? he has a gym in Shanghai. it seems like it\'s quite successful, but it also seems like private lessons with Ramsey might only be fifty bucks. which would seem extremely cheap by western standards, for a private session with a "celebrity" coach.\\n\\nis your "minimalistic" gym now closed for the epidemic with no end in sight? can you stay afloat if you can\'t reopen shortly?\\n\\n**It\'s fake to a certain extent, but not really. I mean people are there for their own agendas, but its not like they\'re cutting out the chances of finding someone either. I was only nervous because I didn\'t know the language at the time. I chose my own clothes. They told me to lift my shirt only when I was on stage, it was not prepared. Theres no green screen. There were no prompts for me. I don\'t watch gordon Ramsey. We talked to the landlord during this epidemic and worked an agreement to hold payments off for the time being until things are better.**\\n\\n Concept fails massively and yet you still think it\'s viable?

Move forward with the things that do work and make a change for the things that don\'t work.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Chinese people don\'t understand ... probably the main reason for the wuhan epidemic\\n\\nDo you feel comfortable making this speculation based on such a sweeping generalization when the US has one of the highest obesity ratings, 4 times that of China, with a fraction of the population, and regular outbreaks of food related illness due to poor regulation enforcement? Loaded question I know, but so are the implications in your post...\\n\\n**It\'s a number of things. But some of the habits here are really much poorer than the US. And the population is much higher. For example, people will spit inside the floors and/or smoke inside restaurants. My concept of fitness is not only about working out, but trying to be a "clean individual". Eat right, do things in moderation, take care of yourself and influence a little awareness to those around you.** \\n\\nHow difficult/expensive would it be to be on a carnivore diet in China? After the Trump-Xi trading fiasco started, costs of USDA choice Ribeyes at Costco in CA went from $5.99/lb to $10.99/lb by the end of the summer and as high as $11.49 during last year. Currently, it hovers at $10.99/lb.\\n\\n**Steaks are generally more expensive in China, I don\'t know why. and with the new outbreak, all foods have been more expensive.**\\n\\nI came to ask if American in China means white. Your bio suggests you regards yourself as American when in China. What do the Chinese regards you as? Chinese or American? Furthermore, do you have a sense of ethnic Chinese regarding you as an outsider?\\n\\n**(Took this response from another user because he was right on point)I\'m not OP, but as an ethnic Chinese person with an American mind, I consider myself American; in China, one I open. my mouth, I\'m regarded as a foreigner. Unlike people of other ethnicities (travel friends), I don\'t often get the nice treatment that an exotic foreigner will receive, particularly with older people there.** ';;;;1582538788.0b'I\\xb4m Ryan Hayashi - The European Champion Of Magic - Fooled PENN & TELLER on FOOL US';;;;3539;;;;f7x941;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f7x941/im_ryan_hayashi_the_european_champion_of_magic/;;;;445;;;;b' Hi reddit,\\n\\nI  am Ryan Hayashi, international magician and creator of the  Psychological Damage Magic series.

Following this period, I returned to school to achieve degrees in engineering, and began my career as a scientist, inventor, and an engineer.  \\n\\nIn my career I've had the privilege of working on projects as varied as the Gillette Venus to locking mechanisms of the Space Shuttle Bay Doors.\\n\\nFurther, I started my own humanitarian engineering company *WorldStove*. This was the first company in the world to be certified as carbon negative.   \\n \\n\\nAdditionally, I have been involved in the United Nations Climate Summits since 2008, and have been an adviser to the European Parliament on Climate Policy and Solutions. \\n\\n**My Platform:** I am a bold Bernie Sanders Democrat. \\n\\n**Global Warming**: I will fight for the Green New Deal. Without immediate, drastic action to combat rising C02 levels, the planet will be left in a global crisis. \\n\\n**Money in Politics:**  I reject the corrupting influence of corporate money, and money from the wealthy elite. We must reverse citizens united, and make it clear that money is not speech. Additionally, we must enact Publicly Funded Elections as to allow the average citizen to run for political office. \\n\\n**Health Care**: Medicare for all, period. No compromises, no watered down half measures. America spends more than any major country on health care, yet we get less access and worse healthcare outcomes. It is time to catch up with the rest of the modern world. \\n\\n**Free College and Trade Schools:** To remain competitive within the global market, we must implement tuition and fee free college education at public universities. Trade schools also need to be free. \\n\\n**A living wage**: I stand firmly behind the Fight For $15. 50% of US residents are struggling to pay for basic life necessities such as food, rent, and heat. Wages have been stagnating since the 1980s, while the top 1% of earners have seen their wealth increase dramatically. Raising the minimum wage is one way to help combat this moral failing within the US economy.\\n\\n**For more information regarding my platform, and my character, please visit the links below:** \\n\\nI. **Campaign Website**: [https://www.mulcahy2020.com/other-issues](https://www.mulcahy2020.com/other-issues)\\n\\nII. **Twitter**: [https://twitter.com/aVoice4MA6](https://twitter.com/aVoice4MA6)\\n\\nIII. **Facebook**: [https://www.facebook.com/Mulcahy2020/](https://www.facebook.com/Mulcahy2020/) \\n\\nIV. **Instagram**: [https://www.instagram.com/mulcahy2020/](https://www.instagram.com/mulcahy2020/)\\n\\n**How you can help:**\\n\\ni. **Volunteering**: To defeat Seth Moulton, we need a strong grassroots movement.

We have suffered for years with runaway housing costs, meager protections from our labor union contract, and an unsympathetic university administration. Between 2014 and 2018, our contract guaranteed an income increase of 3% per year, but rent increased by 54% over the same time period. Between 2018 and 2019 alone, the cost of housing increased by 15%. UCSC grads have very little power to influence the results of these contract negotiations - during the 2018 contract vote, UCSC grads voted 80% AGAINST the agreement, yet were outvoted by grads at other UCs with larger numbers.\\n\\nWith few options left, **over 400 graduate teaching assistants (TAs) initiated a wildcat strike last December by withholding fall-quarter grades**.

My name is [Rich Rotella](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3706252/). When I was a kid, I saw *HOME ALONE* and knew I wanted to be an actor. Now at 35, my first comedic feature film [*MARLO LASKER*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/)\\xa0just came out on Amazon Prime & Prime Video. It took just over $25k, 6 insane days of filming, 2.5 years in post production, while simultaneously acting in other films and I gained 15 lbs to play the lead character "Marlo" while directing & producing as well. I almost DIED from pure exhaustion - mentally, physically, emotionally and definitely financially - to get this crazy movie made but I knew in my heart if I just didn\'t give up and kept the faith... that I eventually would get my comedy out and into the world. When I was starting this movie, my goal was simple... *"Life is very hard. Let\'s make the world laugh again!"* Now, I\'m here and ready to answer any questions you might have about writing, making, and selling a film in the digital streaming era.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in the movie, [*MARLO LASKER*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/) *is\\xa0a lovable nerd, who goes on a series of adventures to defeat Caleb, the school jock, and win the heart of Susie, the girl of his dreams.*\\n\\nFor whatever reason... high school, college students and "stoners" seem to REALLY love the movie... and that\'s awesome. We\'re honored to make a goofy movie for that crowd and beyond.\\n\\nHere\'s the [trailer on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK8ZecOiUNc) and here\'s the [IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/). If you like it, you can see the full movie for free on [Amazon Prime / Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Marlo-Lasker-Rich-Rotella/dp/B083VRKR6K/).\\xa0Check it out, you might be pleasantly surprised.\\xa0\\U0001f60a\\n\\n[Marlo Lasker Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/MarloLasker/).\\xa0 [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/marlolaskercomedy/) of the crazy creator (myself).

I\\u2019m Ivor Williams, Senior Design Associate at the [Helix Centre](https://helixcentre.com/) at Imperial College London.\\n\\nI lead the end-of-life care projects at the Centre, exploring British hospice care and taking a human-centred design approach to unlock the potential of technology to support seriously ill children and their families.\\n\\nHospices provide holistic care for children, young people and adults from the point at which their illness or condition is diagnosed or identified, all the way through to the end of their life, however long that may be. Common misconceptions of children\\u2019s hospice care are that they are very sad places and are only for children who have a very short time to live or who are likely to die. On the contrary, hospices are incredibly life-affirming spaces, full of positivity and light, offering support to children with a variety of diseases and conditions, sometimes for long life spans.\\n\\nI firmly believe design can both improve the quality of life of those living with life-limiting or life-threatening diseases and their families, as well as play a role in shifting perceptions of hospice care.\\n\\n**A bit of background**\\n\\nResearch and innovation in children\\u2019s hospice care are underdeveloped, largely because the diseases and conditions which require hospice care are often very rare, and so the evidence base is lacking.\\n\\nBreakthroughs in medical treatments in recent decades mean children are living longer with difficult conditions, which is a great thing. However, this also means the complexity and needs of children requiring hospice care are growing. We need new processes to respond to those needs, and for their families.\\n\\n**About my work**\\n\\nI work at the Helix Centre \\u2013 an innovation lab working at the heart of healthcare \\u2013 which is an integral part of the [Institute of Global Health Innovation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/global-health-innovation/). Along with colleagues who work in health policy and design, we are trying to unlock the potential of technology to create products, services and experiences in hospice care, such as peer support programmes, advance care planning, memory-making and legacy. I work with other designers, technologists, academics, children and families to see what exists and then use design methods and processes (such as prototyping and workshops) to come up with creative solutions to those needs.\\n\\n**Case study: Chiara chatbot**\\n\\nAs an example, we created a prototype service for parents who care for their children at home. We understood from families that without the support of a hospice, the experience of 24-hour care is endlessly exhausting and they can become quite isolated without proper support. The hospice can act as a great connector to professionals and other family groups. So, we developed a technology prototype, Chiara, which used a conversation agent (\\u2018chatbot\\u2019) to identify the needs of the child and the family and suggest personalised recommendations to groups and services in the hospice. We worked with a leading charity to test and iterate the prototype with families. It is just one of many prototypes we\\u2019re creating at the Helix Centre.\\n\\n**Proof:** [**https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1229424896347951106**](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1229424896347951106)\\n\\n**Supporting materials:**\\n\\nProfile page: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/ivor.williams](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/ivor.williams)\\n\\nProject case study: [https://helixcentre.com/project-childrens-hospice](https://helixcentre.com/project-childrens-hospice)\\n\\nAbout the Helix Centre: [https://helixcentre.com/](https://helixcentre.com/)\\n\\n\\\\------\\n\\nUPDATE \\\\[1PM ET / 6PM BST\\\\]: Thanks very much for your great questions everyone.

Last week I defended my PhD thesis, which you can find [here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1377626&dswid=-1480), including a .pdf link to the thesis summary.\\n\\nBriefly, my work for the past five years has focused on the ways in which insects tune their life cycles to the local climate, and the genetic mechanisms that make such adaptation possible. We've been using the speckled wood butterfly as a model system, a widespread species that varies in its life cycle across Europe. In places with long warm seasons it produces several generations per year; where the season is short, it only produces one generation per year. Many insects show this kind of variation, and when they're economically important (like pest insects), it can make a big difference! Results from our lab have connected the variation in life cycles with variation in circadian clock genes, which may be helping the butterflies tell what time of year it is by interpreting the duration of daylight.\\n\\nMy thesis consists of four papers, two of which have been published elsewhere, [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2550) and [here](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.13525). (Also, [here's a blog post](https://functionalecologists.com/2020/02/04/olle-lindestad-duration-of-diapause-in-butterflies/) about the second paper.) [Proof picture here](https://imgur.com/h6APXqT). Ask away if you're curious about my research, insect science, or anything else!\\n\\n**EDIT**: Thanks a lot for all the questions, this was fun! **Several people wanted to know about how to attract butterflies to their gardens, which I think is great, and can really help with conservation**. There are two parts to this: planting nectar plants to feed the adults, and (most importantly) planting host plants to feed the caterpillars. Different species use different host plants, so look up what butterflies live in your area and garden accordingly. [Here's a great guide](https://butterfly-conservation.org/how-you-can-help/get-involved/gardening/gardening-for-butterflies) for a European context; [this website](https://www.ourhabitatgarden.org/creatures/butterflies-young.html) has some info for North America. As a general rule of thumb, grow some native plants in your garden; this hugely increases the chances that native insects can make use of them. And if you really want to help local insects, be prepared that some of the leaves will be eaten \\u2014 this is, after all, how more butterflies are made.";;;;1581963863.0b'Hi, I am Peter Ben Embarek, a food safety scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), currently part of the international response to the new disease COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2 .

I'm a mechanical engineer by training, am listed on 5 patents, and have worked on dozens of products that went to market - from complex medical systems to simple products having only a single part. On some of these products I was part of team composed of dozens of other designers, but on most products I was the sole designer.\\n\\nIn the early part of my career I worked for large companies that specialized in narrow fields. But being a minority in the late 90's corporate culture, my growth was stifled, so I moved to doing design consulting for companies, inventors and entrepreneurs. The types of products were much broader, and working as a consultant to help people and small companies bring their ideas to market gave me valuable insight into this process.\\n\\nMost people who start down the road don't have a good idea about what it takes to bring a physical product to market. I would guess that only about 20% of the products that I completed ever made it to market.

There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren\\u2019t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. \\n\\n\\n- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. \\n\\n\\n*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You\\u2019ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it\\u2019s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you\\u2019ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.\\n\\n\\nIf anybody has any interest whatsoever in this, please don\\u2019t hesitate to comment and/or PM me.

Because of my last game, the Communist Party of Russia hunted me down, and I was forced into hiding, moving in with distant relatives.';;;;2649;;;;esj7x2;;;;IAmA;;;;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/esj7x2/i_am_developing_controversial_political_games_in/;;;;458;;;;b'EDIT: I have to leave for a couple of hours, but I will be back later. Thank you all for your questions and support! \\n\\nGood afternoon, folks! My name is Georg, last time I did an AMA here,I talked about the challenges of creating a controversial adult game with some releigious overtones in Russia and all the threats that came from the opponents of such content, including religious fanatics and sex-negative conservaties.\\n\\nPROOF: https://steamcommunity.com/games/1085750/announcements/detail/1685970320507554348\\n\\nAnd now, to balance it out, I was able to anger the Russian Communist Party by making another game. In essence, it\\u2019s a branching narrative game about a time traveler meeting with the Joseph Stalin himself. Through the course of the game, you can try to kill Stalin, change his worldview, and even seduce him and partake in some hot gay action with him (cue all the jokes about luxury gay space communism). There are 27 endings planned, each one with an exploration on how the world would look depending on the outcome of your conversation (and actions).\\n\\nIn May I announced the game, there was a slight surge of interest, but I just could not have imagined what would happen next. A small Polish gaming media learned about Sex with Stalin. The Poles generally do not like Stalin for obvious reasons, and they were delighted to see this game, One made by a Russian, to boot. It made some waves on the general european scenes, and ultimately attracted the attention of some of my compatriots who still worship the cult of the Great Leader. Tempers flared, and then even some of the largest Russian state-owned media outlets joined in on the action. At first, there were only a few disapproving nods, but then the host of a political talk show (imagine the very worst of your political commentary show, only with much more shouting) decided to devote a whole episode to the \\u201cDefilers of the Great History of the USSR\\u201d. Representatives of the Communist Party were also invited there. Of course, they could not appear indecisive. The Communists immediately convened a meeting and made a statement that the game should be immediately banned, and the authors punished by fine, or better yet, imprisoned. By making such game, in their opinion, I dishonor the history of our country and insult all the citizens of Russian. Their leader - Zyuganov, called me a Nazi collaborator. They also tracked down Stalin\\u2019s great-granddaughter, and talked her into writing a letter to Putin. Quite a few things in our country can be solved by writing a letter to Putin.\\n\\nAfter this, all hell broke loose. Journalists besieged me - they constantly called me on my mobile phone (so much for privacy), drowned me in vaguely threatening mail, and even came to my hometown and showed the house where I live and all my neighbours\\u2019 houses on live TV. They showed my face, name, place of residence on a number of Russian political shows, and continued to discuss the game in major talk shows. In the evening, after seeing one such show, I decided to go out and get some air to clear the head. Some stranger came up to me, claiming that he knew me from somewhere. I tried to get away from him, but he followed me right to the very doorstep of my house. The very next day, someone threw some eggs at my house windows.\\nBy this time I received so many threats that I started to simply ignore them. In the end, after reading a couple tens of messages about how I should be sent to the Gulag, be shot and maybe then quartered, it\\u2019s unlikely that I\\u2019ll learn anything new by reading another. I decided that I could no longer expose my family and neighbors to all this, and went into hiding. Some distant relatives living in a smaller town sheltered me for a while. Even then I could not sleep peacefully. It was reported that the Investigative Committee (our country-wide prosecution department) began a preliminary investigation, and there was a significant chance that they will go ahead with prosecution. In our country, only about 1% of all cases results in acquittal. You can imagine my dismay. Or maybe you can\\u2019t, but I was very dismayed.\\n\\nI am fond of brewing Russian moonshine called Samogon. This is a pretty fascinating aspect of Russian culture dating back centuries, my grandfather and great-grandfather all did this. I like to drink samogon, too, but I always drank in moderation. But stress from all this happening got to me and I started to drink more, much more. I was incredibly lucky that my relatives who sheltered me supported me and did not allow me to drink myself to death . Then, and I could not believe my luck, it all passed. The media switched to other topics (new sanctions, the threat of war with Iran, etc.). The Investigative Committee either decided not to prosecute, or my case got buried in bureaucracy and there was no political pressure to pursue it anymore. Threats mostly stopped, too.

Every day in our office is like a personal AMA session with each patient, so it's always fun.

I am Dr. Warner Carr, the lead physician for our [Food Allergy Center](https://www.socalallergy.com/allergy-asthma-care/oral-immunotherapy) at Allergy and Asthma Associates of Southern California. We help our patients with food allergies by desensitizing them using a treatment called [oral immunotherapy (OIT)](https://www.oit101.org/listings/dr-warner-carr/). We are also one of the leading research sites for various food allergy treatments to a variety of foods. Here is a paper I was recently a part of: [AR101 Oral Immunotherapy for Peanut Allergy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812856)\\n\\nSo, what is the deal with food allergies anyway? It\\u2019s so common now that you likely have a friend or even a family member with food allergies. In fact, an average of two kids in every classroom has a life-threatening food allergy. I\\u2019m here to clear up the misconceptions about food allergy, discuss current recommendations for food allergy, and answer any other questions in the field that you may have! For example, a common question we get is: what is the difference between food allergy and food sensitivities/intolerance? Food allergies have been controlling people\\u2019s lives. It\\u2019s time we take back that control.\\n\\nI am a board-certified Allergy, Asthma, and Immunologist and would be happy to answer any questions about general allergies, asthma, and any other immunological conditions as well.

I am a pyrotechnic engineer with over twenty years experience in the automotive airbag industry. In 2014, after nearly fifteen years with Takata, I resigned my position as VP of Inflator Engineering and Processing to testify for the U.S.Government. It was my information that led to the criminal charges against Takata, the indictment of three of its executives, and the vast expansion of the largest, most complex recall ever. \\n\\n24 people have been killed and hundreds maimed and injured by Takata's hand grenades exploding only feet from their face. Takata unleashed over 200 million of their moisture sensitive inflators into the word. 100 million of those have been recalled globally, with 70 million in the U.S, and after five years into the campaign, 25 million of that U.S population are still not fixed. 25 million!\\n\\nThe other 100 million Takata inflators have a drying agent. NHTSA was to decide on the 50 million of those in the U.S. by Dec 2019, but passed and all indications are that no action will be taken. A drying agent is only a Band-Aid. Takata's horrendous quality record will guarantee arrows slip through over time. \\n\\nI recently co-authored a book, In Your Face, about my time at Takata, at the center of the storm, trying my best to fight fraud and corruption.

Since our founding in 1944, we have earned a reputation for expertise in infectious disease, supporting our clients to predict, prevent, and control outbreaks such as Ebola and other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. \\n\\nToday, we are fighting against COVID-19 (AKA SARS-CoV-2 corona virus). \\nWe help our commercial and government stakeholders in three areas: \\n\\n1) Evaluate the efficacy and safety of vaccines and therapeutics and develop diagnostic assays to detect COVID-19 in patients and in the environment. \\n\\n2) Develop and share biosafety procedures and offer subject matter expertise and training to partner organizations working with SARS-CoV-2 corona virus and COVID-19 and \\n\\n3) Develop and deploy flyable infectious disease biocontainment systems and mobile diagnostic laboratories that can be fielded wherever needed.\\n\\nWe are working with industry partners to provide cutting-edge solutions for COVID-19 in the USA and globally. Initially, our focus is developing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays, followed by further testing to obtain FDA clearance for the diagnostic assays. In addition, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vaccines and therapeutics, including efforts to discover new antiviral candidates. Simultaneously, we are ramping up teams to support human clinical trials of medical countermeasures that are now under development. With our infectious disease expertise, we are positioned to study the virus and its transmission. As leaders in biosafety with pandemic preparedness expertise, we are sharing our knowledge with the community and businesses.\\n\\nOur work makes a difference in the health outcomes of people around the globe facing the challenges of infectious disease. MRIGlobal\\u2019s subject matter experts have unsurpassed research and technical expertise. That level of scientific excellence is what every client deserves and demands.
