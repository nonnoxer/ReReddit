My previous most viewed post had 0.23k views. To repay a bit for my multiplied Red Sauce Karma, I'll try to summarize most made comments and some good ideas:\\n\\nMost mentioned: additional physical switches, audio recording got most mentions, WIFI as well, I might as well add GPS to the mix for tablets and smartphones. One redditor even wanted sliding slots to close all ports to keep dirt out of them.\\n\\nOn the subject of dirt: one redditor mentioned that slots would add nooks and crannies for dirt to accumulate and make them more difficult to clean. A good design without sharp corners would be best. \\n\\nLaptop lids have gotten smaller and smaller, but in order to be able to fit some sturdy cover you simple have to have a certain amount of millimeters (or whatever fancy crazy measurement system your country uses) to work with. I'm thinking a webcam laying in a shallow indentation combined with a 'mail' slot on the top small border where you could just slide in a made to fit wooden or metal rectangle could work too. That would answer the fears of one smartass Redditor that they could secretly install another tiny webcam on the cover.\\n\\nFor the webcam users appreciate a led that is hard wired electrically wise with the wire for the cam. Apple has assured some people that's how they build them.\\n\\nOn the proliferation of laptops with had or have sliding covers: there were different brands that had them about 10 years ago, then slowly without covers became more like the norm, but users have bought recent laptops with covers as well, e.g. Dell Rugged types, some Lenovo models (surprisingly for me, I wonder if they're allowed to sell them in China itself ;-)\\n\\nA few people were ridiculed years ago for covering their webcam with tape and feel justified now years later.\\n\\nPeople are demanding covers and physical switches for tablets and smartphones as well. \\n\\nA lot of people suggested good moves to make in front of my webcam. The idea of creating a pay-per-view website for me to do silly and NSFW stuff has become very attractive. I'll consider a pay with Bitcoin only rate of only 0.00099 per minute. For some I might go lower if they really do install the mirrored ceiling in their bathroom themselves. \\n\\nI might or I might not get to getting more individual replies out to y'all.

(I may have made that last one up.) Anyway, we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:\\n\\n**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something, it is a scam.**\\n\\nThere are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not, spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold, then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you, [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)\\n\\nMore recently, though, we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely), then they contact users directly, thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages, here's what to do:\\n\\n1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.\\n2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).\\n3. Block the account in question.\\n\\nRemember, everyone, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.\\n\\nThat's why we don't have robotic ferrets yet, sadly.";;;;1584424843.0b'Millennials
